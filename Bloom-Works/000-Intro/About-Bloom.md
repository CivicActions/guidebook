# Welcome to the Team! 
As a Bloomer, it might be helpful to have some background on Bloom - how it all started, what we're trying to do here and some of our core values.

## How It All Began

Once upon a time in 2018, after creating the digital services team for the City of Boston, Lauren started Bloom Works (originally GovBloom, which may pop up) to take what she learned to more agencies. She put together a dream team of seasoned (and brilliant!) designers, researchers, and developers who have led the redesigns of websites like VA.gov and health.gov.

About Bloom

Many of us have experience working in the government, and we know firsthand the challenges of modernizing services. We've worked with legacy systems and bureaucratic teams that made it nearly impossible to put even a simple form online -- or to bring real modern change to the workplace. In that world, when we tried to hire outside help, we found people who were more interested in keeping us locked into their contracts than in solving our problems.

At Bloom, we've made it our business to be different. We're here to help navigate complex paths to make lives easier, and visions more achievable.
We’re inspired by the important work our partners (not clients) are doing, and our mission is to help them build cleaner solutions to digital challenges.

## Our Core Values

*This is the latest iteration from our work as group on it from early 2021

### The best adventures start out as a spacewalk.
We embrace uncertainty and ambiguity since this is how things worth doing start - one step at a time, into the unknown.

### Technology is for everyone.
We use technology to drive towards outcomes, not outputs, and strive for everyone to know how to build it, change it, and adapt it to withstand the future. We will prioritize the useful thing - even if it’s not tech - over something that integrates with your smartwatch.

### Be humble. Show up ready to listen.
We are a team that shows up with our whole heart and whole brain. We learn from one another, from our clients, and users.

### Bring your shovel.
We pride ourselves on being practical, pragmatic, scrappy, and determined to get the job done. We will do what it takes if it means it gets all of us to where we need to be.

### Fiercely prioritize.
In recognizing at the outset that trying to do everything will mean accomplishing nothing, we strive to balance our work against our ability to do it well. We need to deliver, and deliver with quality.
