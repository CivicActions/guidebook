## We have an awesome team which now includes you!

When you join, you’ll be paired with __Lauren or Emily__ as your central point of contact at Bloom. You should have regular check-ins (frequency and format to be determined with them) to make sure you’re getting everything you need to set you up for success and dive into the work.

## Meet fellow Bloomers!

Bloom also consists of rad team members that you may work with on a current or future project. Check out the "Team" list on this board to get a sense of who's on the team. When you get settled in, we encourage grabbing virtual coffee/tea/work-friendly beverage of your choice to learn more about them and what they're working on.
