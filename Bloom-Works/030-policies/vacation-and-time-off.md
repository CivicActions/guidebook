**We all need a break sometimes and we believe in taking the time you need for yourselves and/or your families.** 

Here's some basic guidance on taking time off: 

-  You do not need to justify time off, and whenever possible please try to arrange it in advance with your project team. 

-  Employees receive 120 hours of PTO and 40 hours of sick leave each year (year begins at the time of hire). Up to 40 hours (5 days) of unused PTO and 40 hours (5 days) of unpaid sick leave can be carried over each year ("year" starts at the anniversary of your employment).

-  If, for any reason, you are unable to work the expected hours on your project for reasons other than PTO (if for example your project team or role on the project is blocked) please notify someone on the Bloom management team (Lauren, Emily or Sofia). We will help determine the right next steps.

-  In addition, Bloom is closed from Dec 25 to Jan 1 (6 work days). Full time staffer receive an additional 8 days for floating holidays, you will request this time off in Gusto. Note: unused floating holiday time is not paid out if you choose to leave Bloom. 

- Contractors: please manage your schedule and take the time you need. Please give us some notice where possible and connect with us to discuss making sure our partners are aware of time off (as needed). 

**Whenever possible please give at least 2 weeks advance notice of planned time off, this will help us on project resourcing. **
