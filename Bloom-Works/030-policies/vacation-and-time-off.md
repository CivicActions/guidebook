## We all need a break sometimes and we believe in taking the time you need for yourselves and/or your families.

Here's some basic guidance on taking time off: 

-  You do not need to justify time off, and whenever possible please try to arrange it in advance with your project team. 

-  Employees receive 120 hours of PTO and 40 hours of sick leave each year (year begins at the time of hire). 

-  Up to 40 hours (5 days) of unused PTO and 40 hours (5 days) of unpaid sick leave can be carried over each year ("year" starts at the anniversary of your employment).

-  If, for any reason, you are unable to work the expected hours on your project for reasons other than PTO (if for example your project team or role on the project is blocked) please notify someone on the Bloom management team (Lauren, Emily or Sofia). We will help determine the right next steps.

-  In addition, Bloom is closed from Dec 25 to Jan 1 (6 work days). Full time staffer receive an additional 8 days for floating holidays, you will request this time off in Gusto. Note: unused floating holiday time is not paid out if you choose to leave Bloom. 

- Contractors: please manage your schedule and take the time you need. Please give us some notice where possible and connect with us to discuss making sure our partners are aware of time off (as needed). 

**Whenever possible please give at least 2 weeks advance notice of planned time off, this will help us on project resourcing. **

## Exempt Employees -- Time Off

The following applies to all United States-based, FLSA exempt employees.
In recognition of the professional environment in which we work, exempt Bloom Works employees do not accrue sick days, vacation days, or any other form of time off in any fixed amount. Rather, an eligible employee who is absent from work as a result of appropriately scheduled and approved vacation, personal, or sick time, including for any reason covered by applicable paid sick leave requirements, is eligible for time off with pay under this policy.
Employees are encouraged to take a reasonable amount of time off as needed to feel balanced, productive, and healthy, subject to business needs. PTO is intended to ensure employees may take an appropriate amount of time for vacation and personal time to remain healthy and productive, in addition to necessary paid sick time, exempt employees should generally attempt to take three weeks of vacation or personal time per calendar year where consistent with their productivity requirements and business needs.

Exempt employees do not accrue or carry over time off from year-to-year. Thus, time off will not be paid out upon termination.

## Non-Exempt Employees -- Time Off

The following applies to all United States-based, FLSA non-exempt employees.

Bloom Works believes employees should have opportunities to enjoy time away from work and recognizes that employees have diverse needs for time off from work. Non-exempt employees are responsible for managing their own paid time off to allow for adequate reserves for use when needed. This policy is designed so that non-exempt employees receive PTO at an accelerated pace so that non-exempt employees can have similar flexibility to exempt employees.

Non-exempt employees scheduled to work on average 30 hours or more per week will receive 40 hours of PTO per calendar month, effective the last calendar day of each month. Non-exempt employees scheduled to work on average 30 hours or more per week shall not be allocated a total amount of PTO in excess of 120 hours of PTO. Non-exempt employees scheduled to work on average 29 hours or less per week will receive 20 hours of PTO per calendar month, effective the last day of each month. Non-exempt employees scheduled to work on average 29 hours or less per week shall not be allocated a total amount of PTO in excess of 60 hours of PTO. PTO under this policy is designed to be used by a non-exempt employee who is absent from work as a result of appropriately scheduled and approved vacation, personal, or sick time, including for any reason covered by applicable state or local paid sick leave requirements.

On the last day of each calendar month, non-exempt employees are eligible to use their allotment of PTO at any point, subject to the restrictions and guidelines contained in this policy. PTO is paid at the employee's base salary or hourly rate in effect on the day the PTO is taken, and does not include overtime or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. PTO is not considered as hours worked in calculating overtime compensation for non-exempt employees.

Unused PTO is not eligible for payout at the end of a calendar year. Unless contrary to applicable state or local law, employees are not entitled to payment for accrued, unused PTO upon termination.

## Use of PTO â€“ Exempt and Non-Exempt Employees

Eligible employees may use paid time off under this policy beginning on their first day of employment. It can be used for traditional vacation purposes, personal time, or sick time, including sick time under any applicable paid sick leave law. This includes to:

- attend appointments or receive care for the employee's own physical or mental illness, injury, or medical condition, including conditions requiring home care, professional medical diagnosis or treatment, or preventive care; or
- attend appointments or provide care for an eligible family member's physical or mental illness, injury, or medical condition, including conditions requiring home care, professional medical diagnosis or care, or preventive care; or
- address the psychological, physical, or legal effects of domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault, or stalking involving an employee or an eligible family member, or where applicable, a "household member" (including stepparents and stepchildren, grandchildren, current and former spouses and domestic partners, persons who have a child in common, adult persons related by blood or marriage, adult persons who have resided or are residing together, and persons 16 years of age or older who are or were residing together and who are or were in a dating relationship); or
- take time off when an employee's place of business or a child's school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency or for other health-related reasons; or
- for absences from work when an employee or an eligible family member has been the victim of a family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking; or
- take time off when an employee or an eligible family member is quarantined by a public health authority or health care provider; or
- take time off to attend a funeral, make arrangements for, or grieve following the death of an eligible family member, within 60 days of death; or
- bond with a newborn, newly adopted or placed foster child under age 18 , or an adopted or foster child over age 18 if incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability, if completed within 12 months of birth or placement; or
- take time off for bone marrow or organ donation by the employee or an eligible family member; or
- take time off in connection with an employee's child to attend a school-related conference, meeting, or other event requested or required by a school administrator, teacher, or other professional staff member responsible for the child's education, or to attend a meeting regarding care provided to the child in connection with the child's health conditions or disability.

## Written Documentation of Time Off

If an employee uses PTO for sick leave, including sick leave under applicable state or local law, for more than three consecutive scheduled work days, Bloom Works may require reasonable documentation of the purpose for such leave. If the reason for time off is due to an employee's or a family member's own medical condition, verification from a health care provider is appropriate, but should not explain the nature of the condition and should not result in an unreasonable burden or expense on the employee. If the reason for time off is due to an employee's need for leave related to domestic violence, verification may include a police report, court order or other evidence from the court or a prosecuting attorney, other documentation from a victim advocate, attorney, member of the clergy, a medical or other professional, or an employee's own written statement.

Bloom Works also reserves the right to require documentation verifying an employee's need to use time off, if there are indications of a pattern of abuse, such as repeated use of unscheduled time off on or adjacent to weekends, holidays, or pay day, regardless whether the employee has used time off for more than three consecutive days.

## Time Off and Other Approved Leave

Time off pursuant to this policy is not intended for long-term leave or as a long-term care solution. As such, exempt employees on leaves of absences for more than thirty days, including otherwise unpaid leaves of absences, will not be eligible for paid time off beyond the first thirty days. Bloom Works will require non-exempt employees to exhaust accrued, unused PTO concurrently with extended leaves of absences, including under the Family and Medical Leave Act or comparable state laws, if applicable.

Employees who are eligible for any other paid leave under Bloom Works policies will not receive paid time off under this policy while on such paid leave (for example, parental leave) in addition to other paid leave. Likewise, time off and any other paid leaves shall run concurrently such that the duration of any leave shall not extend beyond the longer of the available leave. For instance, an employee may be eligible for twelve weeks of paid parental leave under CivicActions' policy, but will not be eligible for additional time off after such leave.

Similarly, employees who are eligible for wage replacement benefits while on an approved leave (for example, an employee who is eligible for workers' compensation, short-term disability, or long-term disability) will not receive paid time off compensation except as provided below.

If an employee remains absent for seven or more calendar days due to his or her own illness or injury, the employee must apply for short-term disability benefits through the state-provided plan or, if applicable, a company-provided plan, by contacting [People Ops Team] (<mailto:sofia@bloomworks.digital>) to initiate a disability claim. Absences covered by short-term disability, including pregnancy-related disabilities, are not eligible for paid time off under this policy. However, **Bloom Works will bridge the otherwise unpaid short-term disability waiting period with paid time off.** If the company becomes aware that an absence may qualify for short-term disability benefits, management or the People Ops Team will direct the employee to contact Guardian to apply for short-term disability benefits.

For information or questions concerning this policy and the use of time off during otherwise unpaid leaves of absence or short-term disability the employee should contact **the PeopleOps Team** for assistance.

## Abuse of Time Off

Abuse of time off, including as legally-mandated paid sick leave, may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Disciplinary action may be taken if a pattern of potential abuse of time off develops, if an employee is failing to attain necessary goals for his or her position, or if an excessive number of absences occur that are beyond the scope of any approved FMLA leave, approved disability leave, or leave provided as a reasonable accommodation.

## State and Local Paid Sick Leave Laws

To the extent state or local laws mandate paid sick leave, this policy is intended to ensure that eligible employees who work in those jurisdictions accrue and receive paid sick leave in accordance with those requirements. Bloom Works prohibits discrimination or retaliation against employees because of a request for time off for legally-protected paid sick leave purposes, or use of such time off. If you believe that you have been treated unfairly on account of your use of such time off, or request for such time off, please immediately report this concern to [Sofia] (<mailto:sofia@bloomworks.digital>) so that the matter may be reviewed and appropriate corrective action may be taken.

## Personal Tech Issues

At Bloom Works, we understand that having occasional issues with your home network, power and personal equipment are a normal part of working from home.

### Communication

When you have a technical issue with your home network, power and personal equipment that stops you from being able to work at all, communicate early and often:

1. Ping your team in Slack to let them know you aren't available.
1. Set a Slack status (if you can,) so people know you aren't available.
1. If you aren't able to access Slack, deputize your work contact to let your PM(s) and team know.
1. If the problem lasts longer than 2 hours, [email] (mailto:ca-sofia@bloomworks.digital) and log it in Harvest under Bloom Works: Timeoff, using the task "Technical Issues".
1. If it's persistent, set an out of office message.

## Personal Leave of Absence

Employees of Bloom Works, including part-time employees, who have worked for at least one year may request a personal leave of absence. A leave of absence is for extended periods, typically four weeks or more, where an employee is fully or part-time away from work, for example taking courses/training, handling extended personal matters, completing a personal project, or world travel. Leaves will be discussed on a case by case basis and may be paid, partially paid or unpaid.

## Parental Leave

Welcoming a new child is an amazing time for a family and we want to support employees during this time to take the time to bond with their new child (by birth or adoption, or placement in foster care if the child is under the age of 18, or incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability) and acclimate to the new life ahead. Our policy is that expectant parents can take eight weeks of leave fully paid after 9 months of employment. If an employee has been at the company for less than 9 months or if for any reason the expectant parent needs additional leave, we will review requests on a case-by-case basis. All Parental Leave described in this Policy shall be available for a 12-month period following the birth or adoption of a child.
For birthing mothers there is the additional option to use Short Term disability for additional paid leave time. Please contact Sofia for more information on this benefit.
