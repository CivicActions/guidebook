# [Pairing](../README.md) / A Pairing Framework

There is a tendency during pairing to get lost in the weeds, chasing down bugs or going down various rabbit holes. By using these templates, pairs can keep on track to solve the specific goal at hand.

They provides a place for:

- The pairing requestor to prepare for the session
- The requestor and partner to take notes during the session
- Recording next steps and a brief retro on the session

## Goals of the framework

- Establishing the purpose of the session
- Providing both partners as much information as possible before the session begins
- Providing a place to take notes
- Establishing a consistent format
- Setting boundaries on the session

## Non-goals of the framework

- Determining when to pair and when not to.
- Moving Truss to a “all pairing all the time” model.
- Enforcing a particular pairing style.
- Prescribing any particular tools.

## The framework templates

There are four iterations of the framework that can be used for a variety of purposes. While at first they seem engineering-focused, they are flexible enough to be used cross-practice.

- [Formal pairing](./formal-pairing.md) - The full menu, filled in by requestor
- [Support pairing](./support-pairing.md) - Down to business, fill things in together
- [Mentoring](./mentoring-pairing.md) - Focus on learning
- [Information sharing/Planning](./planning-pairing.md) - We’re explorers!

## Tips on using the framework

It is suggested that the person requesting the pairing session prepares this document and sends it to the pair partner before the session. This is an important step when using this template as a mentoring tool and the mentee should be the one to fill it out for their own learning experience.

- Any bugs, discovered work, and other research should be notated in "Next steps".
- Setting a timer is key - Time flies when you’re having fun

The more often you pair program, the easier it gets!

## Session wrap up

### Next steps

(Note any tasks that remain. Do you need another pairing session? Are there tests to write? Also, record any bugs or other discovered work so they can be brought back to the team to discuss opening any new tickets.)

### Retro

(Allow a few moments at the end of the session to review)

#### The work

- Were the goals achieved?
- Was the work unblocked?
- Was new work uncovered?

#### The session

# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Pair Programming

## Overview

Pairing can be an effective tool in your engineering work, though there are ways
to make it work better or worse. This document serves as a collection of the
best practices that Trussels have discovered, a framework for pairing sessions, as well as an FAQ for solving
common pairing problems.

- [What Works Well](./what-works-well.md)
- [What Doesn't Work Well](./what-doesnt-work-well.md)

- [Resources](./resources.md)

# Remote Pairing Etiquette

- Ask before grabbing the mouse / keyboard

  - Sometimes you need to move the cursor to get it back onto your local screen.
    Try to end each driving session with the cursor already on your screen.

- Turn off notifications or consider using a tool to block other applications
  while pairing

- Make sure to think out loud as much as possible since it can be very difficult
  to follow what someone is doing through screensharing

- If you need to mute the other person or step away for any reason, make sure to
  notify the person you are pairing with

- If you need to take a break, say so and agree to come back after a fixed time
  span.

# Giving Feedback

It’s important to check in with your partner from time to time to make sure
you’re both getting what you need. To this end, you should schedule 1:1s if you
are frequently pairing with someone whether or not it’s a formal relationship.
These meetings can be anything from a casual 15 minute check-in to a periodic
hour-long discussion.

Make sure that you make time for giving feedback to each person. No matter what
the skill level of each of the folks involved is, both parties will benefit from
hearing how the other person is experiencing the pairing. As usual at Truss, we
prefer direct communication when possible.

If you have consistent stumbling blocks, try to take time to think of a couple
of potential solutions before your next check in. This will mean that your
partner has the opportunity to solve the issue in a way that is conducive to the
way you work, which is always a bonus.

# Meeting Attendance with a Pair

Truss has a clear set of values and expectations when it comes to meetings (see
our [blog post](https://truss.works/blog/2017/2/3/well-met-the-software-engineering-meetings-you-actually-need)).
But many of our clients won’t! With that in mind, pairing can become a useful
way to avoid spending all your time in meetings.

While some meeting attendance will be necessary or required, many meetings are
more optional than you think. When you are both invited to a meeting, it doesn’t
hurt to have a quick check in beforehand to make sure you feel that attendance
is necessary for both of you. Some meetings (like standups) everyone should
attend, and others you will attend to gain more context. But often as you become
more familiar with a client, one of you can bring back information to the other.
Alternatively, you may each take on different parts of a project, making
meetings more relevant to one of you than the other. However, make sure that one
person isn’t attending all of the meetings while the other person sits out.

Pairing provides many different growth opportunities. Though we often focus on
the technical and professional, another advantage of our pairing set up at Truss
is that pairing can act as a buffer between client and more junior team members.
We expect each individual Trussel to work side by side with the client, but
junior partners should feel free to lean on senior partners for help if they are
underwater. This also allows junior partners to learn how senior folks handle
difficult requests or situations with clients.

# What doesn't work well

- Having one person drive all the time

  - Even (especially!) if one person is far more familiar with the codebase.
  - Take turns! If you feel you’ve just been watching for too long, speak up.

- Having one person do all the “discovery” work: the work that you do to learn
  about the problem and build context by diving into the codebase, reading docs,
  and asking questions.

- Pairing on a tight time budget.

  - Okay, theoretically we say pairing is more important than a deadline, but
    it’s unclear whether that’s something we can support when the pressure’s on.

- Wandering attention, checking Slack or your phone, generally drifting off.

  - All of these signal to the person that you are pairing with that you don’t
    think the work is worth your attention. It can be particularly easy to fall
    into this when pairing remotely. Be prepared to give the work your full
    attention.

- No matter how excited you are about getting started, don’t start work you’ve
  agreed to pair on without the other person unless there is a reason e.g. time
  pressures.

# What Works Well

- Sitting next to each other and talking through a task.

- Doing a task in parallel, i.e. each doing roughly the same things on their own
  computer.

  - This is especially good when learning a new piece of software, since neither
    of you know it out of the gate, and watching someone explore can feel clumsy
    and wasteful.

- Sharing a computer

- Switching off driving (having the less senior person drive when time less of
  an issue)

- Daily check-ins: discuss the tasks you’ve done since you last spoke/expect to
  do in the near future.

- The task leader goes through a task (at least partially) on their own first,
  and then brings the other person through

- If additional research is needed to continue, make a plan to separate for a
  set amount of time and then return to go over discoveries

- Pair from the beginning of the task/feature/bug fix. Don’t try to start
  mid-effort.

## Specific to Remote

- Screen sharing (MacOS has built-in screen sharing with the Messages app)

- Different time zones:
  - Ensure that the person who is going to start work first the next day knows
    what they’re going to do before you quit for the day. Especially important for
    Junior/Senior pairs.

# Why Pair

- Get to see the tools another person uses.
- Get to see how another person problem-solves.
- Bounce ideas off one another; helps prevent anyone from getting stuck for too
  long.
- Not working in a vacuum/reality check.
- Learn by doing, combined with learn by seeing, combined with learn by hearing
  (AKA all the learning styles at once!)
- Understanding a problem better because you have to explain it (AKA rubber
  ducking.)
- When you’re reporting what you’ve done to someone else, you’ve already had
  practice explaining it.
- Write code with built-in code review! (You still need to open a PR and get a
  review, unless your project lead deems otherwise.)
- Brings engineers up to speed/spreads knowledge.
- Builds camaraderie & collaborative team unity.
