# DEIA: Get Involved

## [Join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KEwz-rAeRg736rC-vCHU5uEL9ZSo0FesXefQHFN03Rg/edit?usp=sharing) the DEIA Working Group

People are encouraged to apply to become part of the DEIA Working Group. We strive to reflect the diversity we seek to achieve within CivicActions. Approved members are allocated time to work on DEIA issues with the Working Group and receive an additional $500 Professional Development budget to advance their awareness.

## Join the Conversation

**#celebrating-diversity**
This Slack channel is for folks who want to share resources or start conversations about DEIA topics. We also encourage everyone to introduce DEIA-related conversations where they are likely to reach the widest and most relevant audience. For example, do you have an interesting article about diversity in recruiting for user research? Consider posting #design or #hiring-open

## Get support

Not everyone is at the same level of familiarity or comfort with DEIA topics, and that's okay. Fortunately our PeopleOps team is in a good position to handle many questions that come up. Team members who have questions or concerns about DEIA topics, but aren't comfortable bringing them to a large group conversation or public channel can reach out to a member of the PeopleOps team.

### DEIA Committee responsibilities

- Receive and understand DEIA survey brief, areas of focus, goals, initiatives and how we are progressing towards our goals.
- Partner with the People Department and provide feedback and additional insights that could help us attain our DEIA goals and/or initiatives.
