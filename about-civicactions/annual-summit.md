# Annual Summit

CivicActions gathers together in person once a year at our annual summit. The location of the summit varies each year, but we aim to make the location accessible so as many team members as possible can join.

## Summit programming
While a few full-team sessions focused on our company vision, a meaningful coin ceremony, and daily openings and closings, the heart of this summit lies in Open Space Technology.
We encourage the release of any expectations about Open Space – we dive deeper into its essence upon arrival. There is no content preparation to do. What we do ask is that you show up with your passions, an open heart, and an open mind. 

## Coin Ceremony
We have a summit tradition of giving appreciation to every person. This is a tradition where we honor and appreciate each other to celebrate who we are and how we show up. There is an added benefit for those witnessing to get a sense of who that person is. We also give everyone a special coin at the event that commemorates the summit.

## Impact Award in honor of Kevin Walsh
At the end of the coin ceremony we will also announce the recipient of the annual Impact Award. The CivicActions Impact Award recognizes a CivicActions team member, partner or client who has made a significant impact over the past year. The award was inspired by Kevin Walsh, who tragically lost his life in the summer of 2022. The grief of losing a friend and colleague was accompanied by the sorrow of losing a person who had such a huge impact on his colleagues, his projects and the greater community around him. Kev’s gift in life was his ability to clear the path for others. His support, encouragement, and acumen made an impact on everyone he worked with. Kev brought his whole genuine self to CivicActions and we wish to honor him by recognizing team members whose impact is also profound. 
“Simple is usually better - for code, writing, design, and life in general.” - Kevin Walsh

## Hootenanny
CivicActions has a lot of musicians on the team and each year they self-organize a performance. Everyone is welcome to participate, no matter their skill-level, and everyone is invited to attend a fun-filled night of music. 


## Social Activities
On one designatved day, we will spend the afternoon in groups doing social activities to encourage team bonding and fun. 

## Airfare

You can book your flight or you can request assistance. We have travel days on the day prior to the summit and the day after.

## Travel to/from airport

You can expense the fare that takes you to and from your home airport. Lyft Line and public transit are encouraged.
We ask that folks arriving and departing the summit destination coordinate taking public transportation together. We'll have a spreadsheet that will track arrival/departure times to coordinate this. We will also have a summit slack channel that will be helpful on those days.

## Food

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We provide a Meals & Incidental Expense (M&IE) per diem. We provide coffee, tea, and lunch on location and team dinners are self organized. 

## Lodging

The hotel is booked in advance and we ask that those who are comfortable doing so share a double room with another team member. 

## Family

We're in the un-conference-style sessions all day from 9-5 and then usually do team dinners in the evening, so it's not very family-oriented, but we know that some folks can't leave their families at home. We don't cover airfare for the family members but we do put you in your own hotel room for the nights of the summit (additional night would be out of your pocket). We ask that you let the summit planning team know as soon as possible if you need your own room for your family.

## Staying to cowork

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Some team members decide to stay one extra day to cowork with each other on their project work (internal or client). The expectation is that those who stay are working a near full day together because it's prodcutive and fun! These team members will get one additional hotel night.

## Extended stay for fun

Some folks have decided to stay longer before/after the summit to take a couple vacation days in a new city. In some cases people invite their families to meet them to enjoy the city together for a long weekend. If you choose to come earlier or stay later the hotel room cost and food costs would be your responsibility.
