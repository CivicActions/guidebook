title: CivicActions Employee Referral Bonus Program
updated: March 18, 2022
---

CivicActions is always looking for good people, and you can help. Research has shown that new hires who come into a company through employee referrals are excellent contributors, stay with the company longer, and are more cost-effective recruits.

That's where you come in! If you know someone who would be a good addition to CivicActions, you may be awarded a referral bonus if you refer a candidate and they are hired.

If CivicActions has worked on a project or a proposal where we teamed with another company in the last 2 years, we likely have a non-solicitation agreement in place with that company. That means we are not allowed to actively try to recruit their staff to come work for us. You should not reach out to our teaming partners to encourage them to apply for jobs here. You are however allowed to reach out to people you know who work for government agencies who might be interested in joining CivicActions, even if they work for one of our government clients.

## Underrepresented Group Incentive

CivicActions believes that it is important that we reflect the communities that we serve. We also believe that by having greater diversity we will be a stronger company that is able to make better decisions. As we scale, it is critical that we are being strategic in hiring talent from populations that are underrepresented in our team.

We offer a larger referral bonus for a referral that results in hiring a Referred Candidate who self-identifies as a member of an Underrepresented Group ("UG") (defined below) at CivicActions, Inc.

## Definitions

1. Eligible Referring Employee - any regular employee of CivicActions, Inc., or CivicActions Digital Services, ULC., excluding:
    1. an employee in executive/senior-level officials and managers;
    1. an employee assigned to the PeopleOps or Hiring departments; or
    1. an employee whose primary job responsibilities include hiring or recruiting.
1. Referred Candidate - an applicant, or an individual CivicActions hiring team is actively recruiting, for a posted job who has either been referred to CivicActions by an Eligible Referring Employee or who indicates in their initial job application they were referred by an Eligible Referring Employee.
1. Referred Hire - a newly hired employee who was a Referred Candidate, has accepted a job offer for regular full-time employment with CivicActions, Inc., and who has started the position.
1. Referred Job Posting - A job posting listed on CivicAction's [company career page](https://civicactions.com/careers#open-positions). the public job description for which an Eligible Referring Employee has submitted a referral to CivicActions for a Referred Candidate, or the job for which a Referred Candidate has applied and indicated who referred them.
1. Underrepresented Group ("UG") - CivicActions determines which Underrepresented Groups to target its recruiting efforts based on company personnel information including federal contractor affirmative action planning, EEO-1 and VETS 4112 reports. While we feel strongly that groups below do not represent diversity in full, we limited the definition of "UG" in this policy because they are relevant, measurable indicators of how effective we are at recruiting and supporting underrepresented talent. Currently a Referred Hire is considered a member of a UG if they self-identify to the company after accepting a job offer as:
    1. a member of an underrepresented racial or ethnicity group including Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaskan Native;
    1. a woman; or
    1. a veteran including recently separated veterans, disabled veteran, armed forces service medal veteran, or an active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran.
1. Referral Bonus - As of January 3rd, 2022 the amount of the Referral Bonus is the equivalent of $1,000 USD, or if the Referred Hire is a member of a UG the amount of the Referral Bonus is the equivalent of $2,000 USD. A Referral Bonus is paid in the same manner and currency as an Eligible Referring Employee's regular compensation and is subject to taxation.
