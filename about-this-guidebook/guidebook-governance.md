## title: Governance

# Governance

Any team member with a GitHub account can make [pull requests](editing-the-guidebook.md) to change any part of the guidebook.

Ideally, pull requests should be assigned to team members who are subject matter experts. For example, changes to the [license file](../LICENSE.md) were assigned to a lawyer (who happens to be a copyleft and FLOSS expert). If you're not sure who to assign the PR too, you might want to ask in the [#docs channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/docs/) in Slack.

## Governance driven by practice area and working groups

We encourage each team at CivicActions (such as a working group or practice area) to take ownership over their respective documentation. To that end, changes to files in certain directories require at least one review and approval from a member of the respective team, and members of those teams will be notified of that PR. For example, changes to the [engineering](../practice-areas/engineering/engineering-calls.md) directory requires at least one review and approval from a member of the [Engineering Team](https://github.com/orgs/CivicActions/teams/engineering/members).

These teams are listed on GitHub as [subteams](https://github.com/orgs/CivicActions/teams/civicactions-team/teams) of the main [CivicActions team](https://github.com/orgs/CivicActions/teams/civicactions-team). If you want to join one of those teams, you can go to the team page and "Request to join". A maintainer of that team will receive a notification and can approve you.

The [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/civicactions/guidebook/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) file in the top level of this repo:

- Maps the governance of subdirectories to their respective GitHub teams and CivicActions practice areas.
- Automatically assigns pull requests to that team for review, when a PR is submitted that.

GitHub team management is an ongoing responsibility of the Docs working group. They can add someone to a team via the [subteam page](https://github.com/orgs/CivicActions/teams/civicactions-team/teams) by clicking **Add a member**.
