# Reviewing pull requests

All pull requests (PRs) are automatically assigned to a team for a review, based on which part of the guidebook is being edited. 

Reviewers are assigned as part of the [guidebook governance](guidebook-governance.md).

## How to review pull requests

Each pull request must be reviewed by at least one other CivicActions employee before it can be merged.

If you feel unsure if the content is accurate, ask somebody at CivicActions who has expertise in that area. For example, if it looks like it needs Project Management team review, ask a PM.

### Step 1: Find the PR 

Navigate to the open pull request. You can get there by clicking on the PR link if you have it, or by clicking on **Pull requests** at the top of the Guidebook repo page.
