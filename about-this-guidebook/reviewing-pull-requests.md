title: Reviewing pull requests
---

All pull requests (PRs) are automatically assigned to a team for a review, based on which part of the guidebook is being edited.

Reviewers are assigned as part of the [guidebook governance](guidebook-governance.md).

## How to review pull requests

Each pull request must be reviewed by at least one other CivicActions employee before it can be merged.

If you feel unsure if the content is accurate, ask somebody at CivicActions who has expertise in that area. For example, if it looks like it needs Project Management team review, ask a PM.

### Step 1: Find the PR

Navigate to the open pull request. You can get there by clicking on the PR link if you have it, or by clicking on **Pull requests** at the top of the Guidebook repo page.

### Step 2: Check to make sure "All checks have passed."

If not, ask the person who added the PR to fix any errors. You can leave a comment about the errors in the PR.

### Step 3: Review the commits and approve

Click **Add your review**.

Review the commits. If the changes look good, make sure you select **Approve**. Otherwise, add your comments or request changes. The merge will be blocked until you or another reviewer approves it.

Click **Submit review** to record your review decision.
