# Why this guidebook is open

Working in the open embodies the [CivicActions culture](../about-civicactions/culture.md). It’s how we think and how we want to be known. 

So we made our guidebook open. It’s available publically so that:

- Current employees and new hires can access it from wherever they are
- Potential job candidates can learn what we’re about and why it’s awesome to work here
- We can showcase our [commitment to accessibility](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/) (and work with the community to fix things when they are not accessible)

And as always, this is not just a work of love: it’s a work in progress.
