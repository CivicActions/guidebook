# Common practices and tools

As part of our [CivicActions culture](../about-civicactions/culture.md), we share a set of practices and tools to be effective communicators, team members [working in Agile](agile/README.md), and managers of client work and company administration.

Underpinning our chosen technology stack is a [required security awareness process](security/awareness.md) that gets everyone set up to work online safely and avoid the scourge of [phishing](security/awareness.md#phishing-and-social-engineering).

## Get support

Request help with internal systems and services (Slack, Zoom, GSuite, Gitlab, CI server, etc.) from our [internal support team](software-and-support/README.md).
