# Common practices and tools

As part of our [CivicActions culture](../about-civicactions/culture.md), we share a set of practices and tools to be effective communicators, team members [working in Agile](agile/README.md), and managers of client work and company administration.

As good caretakers of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) we practice a [Contribute First](contribution/contrib-first.md) approach.

Underpinning our chosen technology stack is a [required security awareness process](security/README.md) that gets everyone set up to work online safely and avoid the scourge of [phishing](security/README.md#phishing-and-social-engineering).

## Get support

Request help with internal systems and services (Slack, Zoom, GSuite, Gitlab, CI server, etc.) from our [internal support team](software-and-support/README.md).
