**Purpose:** To get more people from all practice areas experienced in building a contributed Drupal module as [Contrib First](https://guidebook.civicactions.com/en/latest/common-practices-tools/contribution/contrib-first/).
**Time commitment:** 2-4 hours per week for 4 weeks (5-10% of your time)

Preference given to people with no previous Drupal contribution experience

**What to get out of it:**

* Experience with Contrib First
* Experience with Drupal contribution
* Experience using the Drupal Issue Queue
* Experience working in the open (public)
* A safe space to be new to the process
* Alignment with your personal goals, practice area goals, and company OKRs

**How to bill:**

* Talk to your current project's PM and TL to see if it is something that project could use.  If so, it will be billable to that project.
* If your current project can't benefit from it can be logged as **PRODEV\_COMMPART \-\> Professional Development**
