# Contrib First

Whenever we are building something that could be of use to more than just one project or client, we build it as contributed work first.

## Rationale for contrib first

-   **Fiscal responsibility** - Building it and contributing it means that other government agencies will never have to pay to build the same thing. This helps agencies comply with Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software [OMB Memorandum M-16-21](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
-   **Reusablity** - CivcActions other clients can benefit from work that was already done.
-   **Security** - contributing our work to an open source project like Drupal means it it receives security coverage by the Drupal security team and the public.
-   **Avoiding the gift that never happens** - Clients are not typically supportive of taking working local software that was already built for them and in use by them and then paying to move or refactor that software to be open source. The benefit is too small for the cost. By building it as contributed code first, there is no extra cost.
-   **Development happens in the open** - The issue are public. The commits are public. Everyone can contribute.
