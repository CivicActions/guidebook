# How to create tickets

A ticket (or card) organizes and tracks our work. Creating tickets may also be best learned during a project (on a project-by-project basis).

## Epic

An epic often starts as the big picture and then the user stories fill in the details. A single epic can contain two or more tickets.

As they are prioritized, a group of user stories also can form an epic.

## Who creates tickets or cards

-   Product Owners
-   Product Manager
-   Project Managers
-   Scrum Masters
-   Engineers
-   UX/Design Team

## User story

-   Most tickets should contain a user story
-   The structure of a user story is: As a(n) **X** I want to **Y** so that **Z** (outcome)
-   Describes the **user need** for the work to be done
-   Example: As an anonymous user, I want to see the latest news articles on the homepage so that I do not have to view older articles that I may have already read.
-   Avoid more than one action per user story. Red flags would be commas and "ands". Consider splitting actions into multiple tickets.

## Implementation plan

-   The plan has notes that explain how and where to start
-   Helps if another engineer has to pick up your ticket
-   Often these plans/notes are in the comments field on a Jira ticket

## User Acceptance Tests (UAT)

-   Explains how we validate that this ticket or card works
-   Written in a language anyone can understand
-   Explains what the ticket will not do as well
-   Acceptance Testing is the process that verifies if the installed piece of code or software works as designed for the user
-   Ideally the Product Owner (PO) writes the Acceptance Test for a piece of work
-   Testing with users is an important factor in ensuring the work is performing/created as expected

## QA tests

-   Written step-by-step so that anyone can pass/fail the test
-   The PO will also run through the same test
-   It will also explain the expected results
-   Contains specific directions or steps a tester can follow that ensure what was developed produces what the engineer intended

## Estimates

-   Every ticket must be estimable
-   Estimate tickets at the beginning of a sprint
-   Co-working encouraged!
-   Track your time daily
-   Estimates should consider time for QA (on average +20%)
-   Projects use story points for estimating
