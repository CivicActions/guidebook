# Internal technical support

Need help with CivicActions accounts, tools, or hardware? The fastest way to get help is through **Slack + Assist**.

## To Request Support

- [Start a new request (recommended)](#option-1-ask-in-it-support-recommended): post in **`#it-support`**. A bot will reply and help you turn your message into the right kind of request.
- [Turn an existing Slack message into a request](#option-2-create-a-request-from-an-existing-slack-message-any-channel): use the message **… (More actions)** menu → **Assist** (works from *any* channel).
- [Something private/sensitive](#option-3-private-request-via-the-assist-app): open the **Assist app** (under *Apps* in Slack) → **Raise a request**.

> **NOTE: The `:ticket:` emoji method is being retired.** Please use one of the options below instead.

## Option 1: Ask in `#it-support` (recommended)

Use this for general questions, requests, or if you are not sure what you need.

Using a public channel lets others help if they have the answer, and also helps others who might have the same question later.

1. In Slack, open [#it-support](https://civicactions.slack.com/archives/C0A99058N2W).
1. Type your message (you don't need any special format).
1. The IT bot will reply right away:
    - It may suggest documentation if your message looks like a question.
    - If you're asking for help (e.g. laptop/software/access), it will suggest the right request type with a button to confirm.
    - If the bot can't figure it out, it may ask for more details - or you can click the "Raise request" button if the bot isn't helping.
1. If a request/ticket is created, someone from the support team will follow up in the thread on that request.

## Option 2: Create a request from an existing Slack message (any channel)

Use this when the context is already in Slack - maybe you're in a project channel, a department channel, or a thread where the discussion already started.

1. Find the message that best describes the issue.
1. Hover over the message and click **… (More actions)**.
1. Under **Connect to Apps**, select **Assist**.
    - If you don't see it, use the search box in that menu to find **Assist**.
1. Follow the prompts to create the request.

## Option 3: Private request via the Assist app

Use this when your request should **not** be in a public channel (e.g. something personal or sensitive).

1. In Slack's left sidebar, open [Assist](https://civicactions.slack.com/archives/D011QQRNLRY) under the **Apps** section.
1. Click **Raise a request** - this is under the **Home** tab.
1. Choose the request type and fill in the details.
1. To find your tickets later, return to the **Assist** app and use the **Messages** tab.

## Other scenarios

### Can't access Slack

You can also see your support requests and create new ones through the portal at [team.support.civicactions.com](https://team.support.civicactions.com/) - you can log in with your CivicActions Google Account.

### Emergency: locked out

If you are locked out of your laptop or Google Account - or need emergency help, call or text:

<!-- the number below is formatted unusually to avoid bots picking it up -->

**7<!-- separator to confuse bots--> 60-60-60 <!-- separator to confuse bots-->900**

## Help us close the loop: mark requests as resolved

When your issue is resolved, please let us know - this helps the support team confirm nothing is stuck or silently failing.

You can:

- Click **Change status** in the request thread (see below) and mark it **Resolved**.
- Reply in the thread with a quick confirmation (ex: "All set, thanks!".

## Tips for faster help

Including a little context up front can reduce back-and-forth:

- What you were trying to do
- What happened (and any error message)
- Whether you are **blocked** or it's **non-urgent**
- Device, OS, browser or other software details if relevant
- Screenshots are helpful — avoid sharing passwords, secrets, or sensitive client data

## What internal IT support covers

This team generally supports:

- Internal systems and services (Slack, Zoom, Chrome, Google Workspace, GitHub/GitLab, etc.)
- Internal hardware and access (laptops, security keys, software installs)

For project-specific tools or issues, please reach out to your project's technical lead or the client's IT support team as appropriate. If you aren't sure, you can always ask in `#it-support` and we can help point you in the right direction.
