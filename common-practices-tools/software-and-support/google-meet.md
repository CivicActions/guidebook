## Google Meet v Zoom

While Zoom is our default video meeting service, there are a few use cases for using Google Meet.

-   If your Zoom meeting is being used by another team member when you want to video meet with someone else, you can create a Google Meet call
-   Some clients can access Google products but cannot use Zoom, so your team may default to Google Meet in those cases
-   There is no time limit length for Google Meet calls (wheres as Zoom has limits for the basic users)
-   With both Google Meet and Zoom, you can share the meeting info (link and dial in info), but with Google Meet you can dial someone into the call yourself
-   In Zoom, only the meeting host (or co-hosts) can mute others, but in Google Meet anyone can mute anyone

## Google Meet Specifics

-   Use Google Meet video chats in the browser (no download needed
-   **You can add a Google Meet to a meeting invite** by clicking "Add conferencing" on the event management page.
-   **You can also start or share a Google Meet from Slack** by typing `/hangout`
-   **You can dial people into a Google Meet call.**
-   A Google Meet invite dialog can generate a phone number that people can call
