# Google Docs

-   Google Docs allows you to create and share a variety of documents such as text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and forms.
-   Google Docs should be shared with your CivicActions email account
-   If a link is shared with you, you can add yourself to the share list so you can reference it later on
-   If you are using a template, always make a COPY
-   Update [default paragraph styles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M-q4Wh0TfKctkaHRmJQumsIn_faTimyTub8qu3qGM7k/edit) to match CivicActions standard styles when creating new docs to use/share
-   When you create a document, set permissions so "anyone at CivicActions can find and access"
-   Make sure to place documents & files in appropriate project folder instead of it living at your personal My Drive
