# Sauce Labs

CivicActions maintains a [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) account for cross-browser and cross-device web and mobile app testing.

-   Our plan supports interactive, live testing and developer tools access
-   If needed we can also enable automated testing via [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
-   This service is available to use internally and on client projects
    -   _Note_: some client projects maintain their own cross-browser testing tool subscriptions - in these cases, use the client/project provided tool. If you are unsure, ask your project manager or technical lead.

## Getting Started

-   If you didn't already, click the "Verify Email" button in your invitaion e-mail (Subject: "\[Sauce Labs\] Please verify your email address")
-   Go to [accounts.saucelabs.com](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/) and use the "Google" button to log in with your CivicActions e-mail address
-   Go to the [Live -> Cross Browser](https://app.saucelabs.com/live/web-testing) menu and select your desired browser configuration
-   Click the "Start Test" button to launch the browser

### Testing Local Sites

In addition to testing public endpoints, the service provides [proxy tool](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/) that can be used to conveniently test local sandbox sites.

_Note_: if you need to test sites behind a client managed network boundary (such as internal or pre-production sites), ensure you get the appropriate approvals before using this service.

## Getting Help

-   The [Sauce Labs documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/) is a good place to start
-   You can also ask in the #engineering-qa channel on Slack
-   If you have access issues or account questions, open a [support ticket](README.md)
