# Best practices for managers and team members

The following are suggestions for activities that can be helpful for managers, team members, and project leads. Not all these will be necessary in every circumstance. Managers and project leads should use their discretion to determine the appropriate methods and frequency of these activities.

## Manager on the same project

-   Review project roles with the team member and how project interactions occur (reference project team working agreement). Usually occurs in onboarding.
-   Be transparent with what "hat" you are wearing in an interaction where needed.
-   Encourage and support the team members to share any concerns about the project and help bring them up in the project.
-   Don't only focus on the project in every 1-1, discuss prodev, goals, energy gains/drains, work-life balance, and so on. Try a cadence of at least one 1:1 every other month dedicated to career growth, tailor it as needed.
-   Figure out a balance between what is best for the project and what is best for the team member. find a way to have them align.

## Manager not on the same project

-   Organize a regular 1-1 or slack check-in with the project tech lead (or team tech lead or project manager) to discuss and share feedback about a team member. Try a cadence of at least every two/three months.
-   Ask for feedback from leads, project managers, other team members about a team member's good performance, areas for improvement, and so on. Share those with the team members in a supportive manner.
-   If permitted by the client, find a way to sit in on sprint demos/iteration reviews to see a team member's presentation. Ask as needed, project and product managers about sprint demos/iteration reviews and if they have any specific feedback. Where government background checks are required to work on a project be prepared for permission not to be granted.
-   Look for appreciations for the team member and note it down for future reference. Share/discuss with the team members the appreciation.
-   Discuss project concerns with leads, project manager to figure out ways in which you can support the project or the team member.

## Team member on the same project

-   Discuss project roles with your manager and how project interactions occur (reference project team working agreement).
-   Share concerns about the project and brainstorm ways to resolve them.
-   Don't only focus on the project in 1-1s. Discuss your prodev, goals, energy gains/drains, work-life balance, and so on.
-   Share how you would like your career to grow and what support you would like to receive.

## Team member not on the same project

-   Collect feedback from team members, peers, and project managers about your performance, areas of improvement, and so on. Share those with your manager so they can find ways to support you as needed.
-   Proudly share your project work with your manager and share any appreciations you received.
-   Share/raise project concerns and ask whether you want intervention or escalation.
