title: Best practices for managers and team members
---

The following are suggestions for activities that can be helpful for managers, team members, and project leads. Only some of these will be necessary for some circumstances. Managers and project leads should use their discretion to determine the appropriate methods and the cadence of these activities.

## Manager on the same project

-   Review project roles with the team member and how project interactions occur (you can also reference the project team working agreement). It usually happens in onboarding.
-   Be transparent with what "hat" you wear in an interaction where needed.
-   Encourage and support the team members to share any concerns about the project and help bring them up in the project.
-   Don't focus on the project in every 1:1 (one-on-one). Try a cadence of at least one 1:1 every other month dedicated to career growth, and tailor it as needed. You can discuss prodev, goals, energy gains/drains, work-life balance, etc.
-   Figure out a balance between what is best for the project and the team member. Look into ways to align them.

## Manager not on the same project

-   Organize a regular 1:1 or slack check-in with the project tech, lead/team tech lead, or project manager to discuss and share feedback about a team member. Try a cadence of at least every two/three months.
-   Ask for feedback from leads, project managers, and other team members about a member's performance, areas for improvement, and so on. Share those with the team members in a supportive manner.
-   If the client permits, find a way to attend sprint demos/iteration reviews to see a team member's presentation. Ask, as needed, project and product managers about sprint demos/iteration reviews and if they have any specific feedback. Where government background checks are required to work on a project, be prepared for permission not to be granted.
-   Look for appreciation for the team member and note it down for future reference. It would help if you shared/discussed this appreciation with the team members.
-   Discuss project concerns with leads/project managers to figure out ways in which you can support the project or the team member.

## Team member on the same project

-   You should discuss project roles with your manager and how project interactions occur (you can refer to the project team working agreement).
-   Share concerns about the project and brainstorm ways to resolve them.
-   Focus on more than the project in 1:1s. Discuss your prodev, goals, energy gains/drains, work-life balance, etc.
-   Share how you would like your career to grow and what support you would like to receive.

## Team member not on the same project

-   Collect feedback from team members, peers, and project managers about your performance, areas of improvement, and so on. Share those with your manager so they can find ways to support you as needed.
-   Share your project work with your manager and any appreciation you received.
-   Share/raise project concerns and ask whether you want intervention or escalation.
