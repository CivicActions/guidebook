# Project support accessibility guidelines

## Our commitment to accessibility

The CivicActions Support practice area is committed to following the guidance provided in the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov/) and following the best practices for inclusive customer service such as the [AODA Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11). CivicActions is committed to providing a barrier-free environment for its customers, clients, and staff and to providing our support in a manner that respects the dignity and independence of people with disabilities.

## Organizational scope

This guidance applies to every person who provides support to members of the public, end users, and/or other third parties on behalf of CivicActions.

## Laws and rules

The standards, rules, and guidelines on providing accessible customer service are set out in the:

-   [Accessibility Standards for Customer Service (Ontario Regulation 429/07)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/r07429)
-   [ADA Requirements: Effective Communication](https://www.ada.gov/resources/effective-communication/)

As standards, rules, and guidelines develop, the CivicActions Support practice area will continue to consult with Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs) and General Counsel to ensure our policies are current, reflective of global needs, and implemented company-wide.

## Training

Each member of the project Support team will complete - within the first ninety days of onboarding - the edX Introduction to Web Accessibility course to help build understanding about disability: [https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)

## Accessible websites and web content

Our goal at CivicActions is to achieve or exceed the latest [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) for all our websites. WCAG is recognized globally as standard best practice and is backward compatible with previous versions. It also incorporates the criteria for digital content included in [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act[(https://www.access-board.gov/ict).

## Information and communication

Communication is provided in a way that is consistent with the core principles of independence, dignity, integration, and equality of opportunity. For more information, please refer to the following links:
