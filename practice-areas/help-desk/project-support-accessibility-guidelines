# Project support accessibility guidelines

## Our commitment to accessibility

The CivicActions Support practice area is committed to following the guidance provided in the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov/) and following the best practices for inclusive customer service such as the [AODA Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/05a11). CivicActions is committed to providing a barrier-free environment for its customers, clients and staff and to providing our support in a manner that respects the dignity and independence of people with disabilities.

## Organizational Scope

This guidance applies to every person who provides support to members of the public, end users or other third parties on behalf of CivicActions.

## Laws and Rules

The standards, rules and guidelines on providing accessible customer service are set out in the:

- [Accessibility Standards for Customer Service (Ontario Regulation 429/07)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/r07429)
- [ADA Requirements: Effective Communication](https://www.ada.gov/resources/effective-communication/)

As standards, rules, and guidelines develop, the CivicActions Support Practice Area will continue to consult with Subject-Matter Experts and General Counsel to ensure our policies are current, reflective of global needs, and implemented company-wide.

Accessible Websites and Web Content
Our goal at CivicActions is to achieve or exceed the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA for all our websites. WCAG is recognized globally as standard best practice, and is backward compatible with previous versions. It also incorporates the criteria for digital content included in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Communication is provided in a way that is consistent with the core principles of independence, dignity, integration and equality of opportunity. For more information, please refer to the following links:
