# Drupal for everyone

CivicActions was an early adopter of Drupal in 2004 and it has been a core technology utilized by our company since, from progressive non-profits to NGOs, to government agencies helping serve the public. Our employees include 25+ module maintainers maintaining 60+ modules, 10+ core contributors, 35+ community contributors, members of key Drupal teams, organizers of key Drupal camps and cons. Previous employees have developed important Drupal distributions and modules that have made their way into Drupal core. Drupal has been a vital part of many of our successes and our commitment to Drupal keeps growing.

## Why should everyone at CivicActions know about Drupal?

As a core technology used by CivicActions, it is important for everyone at CA to have a degree of familiarity with Drupal regardless of role. This familiarity can deepen your understanding of the interactions a client has with the products and services that CA provides. You become a better gauge of a client's needs and of how those needs can be met (both in terms of approach and effort).

Drupal is supported by a large community and CivicActions strives to be a contributing and positive presence. Participation in the community is driven by an alignment of interests, values and principles. Our participation also has the pragmatic effect of highlighting the Drupal-expertise within CivicActions, which helps to attract new talent.

Your depth of knowledge about Drupal should at least be commensurate with your role. While there are many resources available, both online and within CivicActions to help you learn, you should also consider participation within the larger Drupal community. Participation is an immersive and meaningful mechanism for learning and opportunities are available for both technical and non-technical roles.

## What is a CMS?

CMS is short for content management system. A content management system is a software package that allows users to build and manage a website without having to know how to code it from scratch. They provide a friendly user interface that lets users add content such as styled text, images, and other media to their site.

## What is OSS?

From the first year of operations, CivicActions was committed to openness. This openness stemmed from a commitment to the principles behind Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), like Drupal and the same FOSS principles which drive the thriving Drupal community. This radical openness helped to define our culture. Our team members have shared best practices at hundreds of conferences over the years, as well as contributed code to hundreds of FOSS communities beyond Drupal. To this day, we believe in making the world better not only through our client deliverables, but also through sharing our learnings openly.

## Why do we choose Drupal?

Drupal is an extremely popular open-source content management system (CMS) used for building websites and applications. There are many reasons why some of the most high-trafficked and essential web sites on the internet are built on Drupal:

-   **Customizability:** Drupal is highly customizable in terms of functionality, layout, and design. This makes it an ideal choice for complex websites with specific requirements.

-   **Scalability:** Drupal is highly scalable. It can handle high traffic loads and complex data manipulation. It is used by many high-profile websites and can support businesses as they grow.
-   **Community and Support:** Drupal has a vast and active community of developers contributing to its core and creating additional modules (plugins). This ensures that the platform stays up-to-date and can provide support for any issues.
-   **Security:** Drupal has a strong reputation for its focus on security. It is known for its proactive community that takes security vulnerabilities very seriously, providing regular updates to address any potential issues.
-   **Built-in Web Services:** Drupal 8 and later versions come with built-in web services. This makes it a great choice for building headless applications where the front-end is decoupled from the backend, using Drupal to serve content via an API.
-   **Multilingual Capabilities:** Drupal provides robust multilingual features, making it an excellent choice for international and multilingual sites.
-   **SEO Friendly:** Drupal's flexibility and configuration options make it SEO-friendly, meaning websites made with Drupal can potentially rank higher in search engines.
-   **Content Workflow Management:** Drupal's built-in tools for content creation, workflow, and publishing allow multiple users to collaborate and manage content.
