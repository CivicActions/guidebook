## Objective

Every two weeks, we hold a one-hour meeting for the whole engineering team.

This is a space for us to expand beyond our typical practice area, broaden our skills, and develop a richer understanding of the work we do.

## Format

The engineering call follows an [open space format](https://www.facilitator.school/blog/open-space-technology).

In advance of the call, or in the first couple of minutes of the call:

-   Add any/all topics you want to talk about to [our Trello board](https://trello.com/b/wd0WmGlx/engineering-meeting)
-   Upvote any Trello topics that you would be interested in talking about

Topics can be anything you are interested in learning, sharing or chatting about:

-   You don't need to be an expert or have anything to contribute (except questions!) to suggest a topic
-   Examples of topics could range from:
    - a deep dive into a specific language feature
    - a discussion on a new technology
    - group debugging of some gnarly bug
    - exploring process improvement idea
    - or anything else!

On the call we will:

-   Split into Zoom breakout rooms to discuss through each topic
-   Feel free to change groups if you like: this is encouraged!
-   Regroup for a few minutes at the end to catch up on any insight we want to share
