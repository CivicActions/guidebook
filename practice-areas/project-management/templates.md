# Templates

## Purpose

Templates allow us, as a practice area, to deliver consistency across projects. Those included are commonly used by Project Managers throughout the life of a project. All of the templates are stored within the [CivicActions Project Management Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8h3s4uUHTrZX0g0d1gzWVJ2OHM). Given the ongoing improvements of our team, this page is dynamic.

## Budget impact

If a project requires additional resourcing, i.e., for a work surge or else to support CivicActions as a whole, then we have a template for awareness.

How? Use Slack, the project Core channel, and this framework, requesting alignment and opening it for questions:

-   Rationale for adding/increasing resourcing
-   Impact to financial health (i.e., the effective rate is predicted to be $X for Y months)
-   Expected duration
-   Please CC Alaine, Elizabeth and Bill

## Budget tracking

Budget is commonly a part of weekly or monthly reporting. A few options are included:

## Client change request

Some project contracts require formal change requests when modifying key personnel, deliverables, budget, etc. This template helps to initiate change with the contracting officer representative (COR).

## Client Integrated Project Plan (IPP)

If an Integrated Project Plan (IPP) is required, this template is a good starting point for learning.
