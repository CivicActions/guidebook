# Templates

## Purpose

Templates are a great way to become efficient at communicating project status. They also allow us, as a practice area, to deliver consistency across projects. The templates below are commonly used by Project Managers throughout the life of a project. All of the templates are stored within the [CivicActions Project Management Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8h3s4uUHTrZX0g0d1gzWVJ2OHM). Given the ongoing improvements of our team, this page is dynamic.

## Budget Tracking

The following templates can be helpful for budget tracking to include in weekly status reporting.

## Client Change Request

Some project contracts require formal change requests when modifying key personnel, deliverables, budget, etc. This document can serve for initiating change with the contracting officer representative (COR).

## Client Integrated Project Plan

If the project requires an Integrated Project Plan (IPP), this template is a good starting point. This is not a large fixed plan, instead a living document as we learn more about the project. It will be important that the Project Manager updates this plan as more is discovered.

## Weekly Status Report

This template is used as a guide for Project Managers to send weekly status updates to their Product Owner / client. We want our clients to have access to this type of important reporting easily and often. This status report provides the client with critical budget updates, lists new risks, outlines any major decisions, provides a summary of the work that week, etc. If a project calls for a monthly status report (MSR), these weekly reports should provide all the information to construct the MSR.
