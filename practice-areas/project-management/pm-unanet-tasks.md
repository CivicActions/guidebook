# Project Management: Unanet tasks and training materials

Unanet is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that CivicActions leverages for time tracking, planning, forecasting, and accounting. As a project lead, you're responsible for the following Unanet tasks:

1. People planning and assignments
2. Adjusting projections for holidays or other OOO
3. Reviewing and approving timesheets
4. Reviewing and approving expenses
5. Runnings reports
    - Plans v Actuals
    - Planned Utilization

## Adjust projections for holidays or other OOO

In general, resource allocations can be expected using the following ratios:

1. If a FT resource devoted to the project, then 80%
2. If an AD resource devoted to the project, then 65%
3. If a PT resource devoted to the project, then 40%

From that place, then deduct - monthly - for any of the following:

1. Holidays
2. OOO
3. Any other events, such as summits

Pro tip: For finding OOO dates on the calendar, use the CivicActions shared calendar and try searching "name OOO". This will allow you to isolate the forthcoming dates for the given person.
