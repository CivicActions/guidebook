# The Project Manager Role

Project Managers envelop the unique opportunity to hold a project on task and budget - which is paramount - yet also to include accessibility best practices at every stage; be a role model for effective communication; support and enable innovation; and also remove impediments so that the best development, serving all users, is delivered.

## The difference between the Project Management and ScrumMaster roles

There is a lot of overlap between Project Managers and ScrumMasters, especially as agile is intrinsic to our work. Often the role selected ties directly to the contract, with GSA definitions leading the decision. Both roles serve to manage all ceremonies and to support the DevTeam. The main difference is that Project Managers also undertake budeting, reporting, risk, resourcing, confirming QASP metrics are met, verifying all project deliverables, strategy, etc. 

Given that the main objective, however, is a self-sustaining team, neither role is a gatekeeper and instead the Dev Team has access to all client communications, documents and a direct relationship with the Product Owner.

This pages serves to define the Project Manager role in agile ceremonies.


## Scrum

### Primary Responsibilities

- Taking and distributing notes (if the team supports this method)([scrum note template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17tl3lPu-3Uo6_YCEtb6AH9HsaILLS1UTmoUFIuXoqDc/edit))
- Timebox monitoring for the 15-minute call
- Sticking to the scrum process, or holding the team accountable to after meeting topics
- Keeping the team abreast on all important events, e.g., deployments, due dates, blockers, etc.

### Other tasks

- Paying attention to balance scores
- Reminding the team about expectations for forthcoming ceremonies, e.g., the Review
- Tackling all impediments raised
- Sending meeting invites as requires


## Sprint Review/ Demo

### What is a Review?

- A great ceremony to provide an informal demo from the Dev Team (everyone, including UX, Design, Developers, DevOps) to show their work
- The work does not require completion
- Instead, it is an opportunity to focus on user value and to garner feedback from the Product Owner and all stakeholder groups


### Responsibilities

- The Project Manager role is as facilitator 
- Recording the call, if possible, is positive
- Support the team by providing details about the Review prior, e.g., who is showing which tickets. Be sure to include the ordering; a simple table works well
- Always give your team preparation time, reinforcing the need to speak to user value
- The Project Manager starts the call and explains the agenda, purpose, timebox, and any processes changes from the last call
- Notes, especially in real time and made transparent, are encouraged
- Any subsequent actions, i.e., new tickets, discovery calls, etc., are under the purview of the Project Manager


## Retrospective

Retrospectives are imperative for a trust, self-sustaining, innovative team. They work best at the end of every sprint. They are used also at the end of a project or major initiative. 

### Responsibilities

- Scheduling
- Facilitating
- Keeping to the timebox
- Ensuring all voices are heard 
- Documenting the outcomes 
- Helping the team keep and meet their commitments

## Refinement

Refinement calls are an important manner for the DevTeam to connect directly with Product Owners and stakeholders. Having them on a regular, consistent cadence builds trust and also saves confusion as people will often save their agenda items/ ideas for the call. 

### Responsibilities

- Coordinating with the Product Manager, share suggetions with the Product Owner and Dev Team prior, including from whom answers will be most appropriate
- Share your screen to look at the backlog together
- Confirm that all tickets include a user story; story points; technical details; any dependencies and also acceptance criteria
- Ensure the Product Owner and DevTeam have identified the highest priority tasks for both the forthcoming sprint and also the quarter/ PI

### Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is often overlooked, yet is an excellent moment to confirm Dev Team velociy expectations, call out any dependencies or blockers, plus garner acceptance from the team for the work. 

### Responsibilities

- Coordinating with the Product Manager, share tickets prior to the call
- Confirm the work load per Dev Team member
- Allow an open space for questions and concerns
- Ask the team and Product Owner to call our any risk
- Verify that assignments, per Dev Team member, are on target


## Any other meetings

Other ways that the Project Manager supports the team includes, yet is not limited to, the following:

- Setting Team Working Agreements (TWAs)
- Reviewing QASP metrics
- Confirming all deliverables are being met, including those of DevOps
- Talking about workflow
- Decisions from a Retrospective
- Assessing UAT
- etc.

During these types of meetings the Project Manager again serves as facilitator: 

- Scheduling
- Confirming all participants have a voice
- Respecting the team's time by staying within the allotted window
- Making the meeting notes transparent
- Supporting the team with reminders on deadlnes, big picture connections, etc. 
- Ensure there is ownership for each action item
- Create any tickets or documents necessary
