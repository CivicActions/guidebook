# The Project Manager Role

Project Managers envelop the unique opportunity to hold a project on task and budget - which is paramount - yet also to include accessibility best practices at every stage; be a role model for effective communication; support and enable innovation; and also remove impediments so that the best development, serving all users, is delivered.

## The difference between the Project Management and ScrumMaster roles

There is a lot of overlap between Project Managers and ScrumMasters, especially as agile is intrinsic to our work. Often the role selected ties directly to the contract, with GSA definitions leading the decision. Both roles serve to manage all ceremonies and to support the DevTeam. The main difference is that Project Managers also undertake budeting, reporting, risk, resourcing, confirming QASP metrics are met, verifying all project deliverables, strategy, etc.

Given that the main objective, however, is a self-sustaining team, neither role is a gatekeeper and instead the Dev Team has access to all client communications, documents and a direct relationship with the Product Owner.

This pages serves to define the Project Manager role in agile ceremonies.

## Scrum

### Primary Responsibilities

- Taking and distributing notes (if the team supports this method)([scrum note template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17tl3lPu-3Uo6_YCEtb6AH9HsaILLS1UTmoUFIuXoqDc/edit))
- Timebox monitoring for the 15-minute call
- Sticking to the scrum process, or holding the team accountable to after meeting topics
- Keeping the team abreast on all important events, e.g., deployments, due dates, blockers, etc.

### Other tasks

- Paying attention to balance scores
- Reminding the team about expectations for forthcoming ceremonies, e.g., the Review
- Tackling all impediments raised
- Sending meeting invites as requires

## Sprint Review/ Demo

### What is a Review?

- A great ceremony to provide an informal demo from the Dev Team (everyone, including UX, Design, Developers, DevOps) to show their work
- The work does not require completion
- Instead, it is an opportunity to focus on user value and to garner feedback from the Product Owner and all stakeholder groups

### Responsibilities

- The Project Manager role is as facilitator
- Recording the call, if possible, is positive
- Support the team by providing details about the Review prior, e.g., who is showing which tickets. Be sure to include the ordering; a simple table works well
- Always give your team preparation time, reinforcing the need to speak to user value
- The Project Manager starts the call and explains the agenda, purpose, timebox, and any processes changes from the last call
- Notes, especially in real time and made transparent, are encouraged
- Any subsequent actions, i.e., new tickets, discovery calls, etc., are under the purview of the Project Manager

## Retrospective

Retrospectives are imperative for a trust, self-sustaining, innovative team. They work best at the end of every sprint. They are used also at the end of a project or major initiative.

### Responsibilities

- Scheduling
- Facilitating
- Keeping to the timebox
- Ensuring all voices are heard
- Documenting the outcomes
- Helping the team keep and meet their commitments

## Refinement

Refinement calls are an important manner for the DevTeam to connect directly with Product Owners and stakeholders. Having them on a regular, consistent cadence builds trust and also saves confusion as people will often save their agenda items/ ideas for the call.

### Responsibilities

- Coordinating with the Product Manager, share suggetions with the Product Owner and Dev Team prior, including from whom answers will be most appropriate
- Share your screen to look at the backlog together
- Confirm that all tickets include a user story; story points; technical details; any dependencies and also acceptance criteria
- Ensure the Product Owner and DevTeam have identified the highest priority tasks for both the forthcoming sprint and also the quarter/ PI

### Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is often overlooked, yet is an excellent moment to confirm Dev Team velociy expectations, call out any dependencies or blockers, plus garner acceptance from the team for the work.

### Responsibilities

- Coordinating with the Product Manager, share tickets prior to the call
- Confirm the work load per Dev Team member
- Allow an open space for questions and concerns
- Ask the team and Product Owner to call our any risk
- Verify that assignments, per Dev Team member, are on target

### Any other meetings

Occasionally the development team needs to meet to plan or process things together. Some examples of these types of meetings may be:

- Setting working agreements
- Changing workflows for code review, merge requests, QA, etc.
- Direction to take with decisions from a retrospective
- Adjusting how the team works together
- Discussing a failing test that team needs to figure out
- Deciding on automated testing processes
- Assessing user testing feedback
- Demos and their outcomes

During these types of meetings the PM should do the following:

- Schedule the meeting & send out the invite
- Timebox the meeting appropriately and ensure the team sticks to the timebox
- Make sure the appropriate team members are in the meeting (and marking others as optional if not critical)
- Summarize the purpose and goal of the meeting (both on the invite and state it at the start of the meeting)
- Ensure the team stays on topic to meet the goal and get the outcome needed
- Document the meeting notes and share with the appropriate mailing list
- Clearly outline next steps and action items for the team
- Ensure there is ownership for each action item & the team knows the due dates if applicable
- Create any tickets or documents necessary (even if it is just a stub ticket or document template)
- Follow up on the action items the team agreed to & help them stay accountable to their commitments
