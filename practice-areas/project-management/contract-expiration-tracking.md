title: "Tracking Contract Details: Leveraging Project Wrappers"

## Wrappers

Wrappers are documents that provide critical contract details. All projects include a Legal and a Project Management Wrapper. These two documents serve to point Project Managers - and any other CivicActions employee - to what we are obliged to deliver.

## Contract Management

All contracts can be tracked via the [Client Contract Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vEcmuGy2ZZEBIAWYxKvqpaUvEIj1iVzamPduMnHqQ1A/edit?pli=1#gid=1951421606). The Legal Wrapper is available via this index, with a link to the Project Management Wrapper included.

## Tracking Contract Dates

On the Legal Wrapper (see [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BTkjJ2N8iPPsuxjb3cLfaqe30nfVQHSgs8cuWaFKalw/edit)), the <b>Awarded period of performance (initial)</b> section which will include contract dates.

A link to all contracts is included at the top of the Legal Wrapper, on the <b>Contract folder</b> row. The linked folder will include all base and modification contracts, including additional documents (e.g., SOOs, etc.).

## Project Folders

On the Project Management Wrapper (see [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eh6L6IiBF6DbOKzIPM2pRZXhBFBb0hbVVtq-f8HlxEQ/edit#)), note the links to both Internal and External folders.
