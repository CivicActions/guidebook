## Project calendars

Most larger projects have their own Google Calendar, which is often created by the Project Manager. This allows for easy visibility - and editing capacity - to project events for all team members.

## Calendar creation tips

-   Upon calendar creation, name the calendar to align with the client, unless there are concurrent projects for the client
-   Edit all events on the project calendar instead of personal calendars
-   Settings: Auto-accept invitations > Automatically add all invitations to this calendar
-   Settings: Access permissions > Make available for CivicActions > See all event details
-   Settings: Share with specific people > Invite all CivicActions project team members to the calendar
-   Direct team member should be able to > Make changes to events
-   Settings: Share with specific people > Invite delivery and Ops team members as appropriate to the calendar
-   Indirect team members should be able to > See all event details
-   It is typical that clients are invited to events on a project calendar

## Contractual Calendar

All Project Managers also have access to the Contractual Dates calendar, whose purpose is to highlight start and end dates for all projects.
