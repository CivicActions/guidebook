title: Fostering innovation on project teams (MVP)
---

Innovation is a key component to CivicActions work. We are committed to bringing innovation forward to our clients and - most especially - for end users. Innovation, therefore, is encouraged from all team members. The Project Manager is positioned to support the project team via the following (MVP version) process:

## Challenge Overview

-   We aspire to confirm that all innovative ideas are heard, acknowledged, and that the contributor is made aware of next steps (and that we have the capacity to follow-up on the needed action items)
-   We work to ensure we are equipped to move forward on innovative ideas, in order to demonstrate we are hearing (and acting on) team suggestions and to avoid creating a "graveyard of good ideas" paradigm

## Objectives

-   We encourage ideas to be "bigger" than a given sprint or retro, and welcome all input, motivating/coaching team members to think "big picture"
-   We allow innovative ideas to be shared (and captured) across the entire project (all teams)
-   We create a simplified means of assessing Level of Effort (LOE), Return On Investment (ROI), etc., so we may adequately prioritize potential work
-   We ensure there is an easy way to view the status of ideas and to parse themes
-   And we formally incorporate this process into [Team Working Agreements (TWAs)](team-working-agreements-instructions.md)

## Phase one - MVP process (aka starting simple)

-   Begin by leveraging existing team retros, working with ScrumMasters
-   Create tickets in Jira (or another medium) for innovative ideas
-   Tickets should be tagged in a certain, yet consistent, manner (e.g., specific labels, components, issue type, etc.)
-   Establish a custom, program-level board for tracking (or incorporate the innovation tickets into the existing backlog)
-   Handoff ticket(s) to the Technical Lead (or another fitting role) for review during project leadership calls
-   Request that the Technical Lead determine feasibility, LOE, ROI, etc., around the concept (and also noting feedback in the ticket, for transparency)
-   Plan next steps and potentially schedule work where appropriate

## One more thought

Innovation occurs at the project level and also across CivicActions. Great ideas can be shared on AHCs, in practice area calls, on Slack for focus-area groups (e.g., DevOps, Front End, etc.) Innovation is also an intrinsic part of project team AHC demos and in monthly and bi-weekly reporting to the client. If our team is innovating to improve processes, technical viability, etc., please share it!
