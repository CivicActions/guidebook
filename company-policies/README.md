# CivicActions policy overview

Our company policies are the formal rules or requirements that align with our goals. A policy is CA's official position: its associated steps or procedures are either in, or linked from, the policy.

## Developing policy content

While this guidebook typically is open for any team member to make contributions, policies are treated differently. They are developed, reviewed, and approved solely by the management team. If you see something in a policy that is not clear, send a Slack DM to your manager.
