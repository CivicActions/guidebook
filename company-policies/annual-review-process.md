# Annual performance review

CivicActions uses Culture Amp to administer annual reviews. Culture Amp offers asynchronous, scalable review processes, including self reflection, peer feedback, and manager feedback.

## Value

As a company, we want to continuously move towards an open culture where we can give feedback early, often, and openly.
Our regular feedback and review cycles help us accomplish this. The process isn't cumbersome and the reviewee leaves with actionable and valuable feedback. It has also led to our entire team regularly getting practice in giving their peers and managers constructive feedback.

## How it works

We have an annual review season and reviews are delivered in the last two weeks of April. In Culture Amp, you will do a self reflection about the previous year and two of your peers will give you feedback. Your manager will take that feedback and complete their review as well. Your manager will meet with you to discuss the feedback and any compensation changes and data about your hours and utilization over the past year.


## When it happens

The review season starts in January and concludes in April with reviews being delivered. Below are the phases and who is involved in each phase.

Phase 1: Prep (PeopleOps)
Phase 2: Reflect and Feedback (Entire Team)
Phase 3: Analysis (PeopleOps and Leadership)
Phase 4: Approvals (PeopleOps and Executives)
Phase 5: Review Delivery (Entire Team)
