# Annual performance review

CivicActions uses Culture Amp to administer annual reviews. Culture Amp offers asynchronous, scalable review processes, including self reflection, peer feedback, and manager feedback.

## Value

As a company, we want to continuously move towards an open culture where we can give feedback early, often, and openly.
Our regular feedback and review cycles help us accomplish this. The process isn't cumbersome and the reviewee leaves with actionable and valuable feedback. It has also led to our entire team regularly getting practice in giving their peers and managers constructive feedback.

## How it works

We have an annual review season and reviews are delivered in the last two weeks of April. In Culture Amp, you will do a self reflection about the previous year and two of your peers will give you feedback. Your manager will take that feedback and complete their review as well. Your manager will meet with you to discuss the feedback and any compensation changes and data about your hours and utilization over the past year.

## When it happens

The review season starts in January and concludes in April with reviews being delivered. Below are the phases and who is involved in each phase.

- Phase 1: Prep (PeopleOps)
- Phase 2: Reflect and Feedback (Entire Team)
- Phase 3: Analysis (PeopleOps and Leadership)
- Phase 4: Approvals (PeopleOps and Executives)
- Phase 5: Review Delivery (Entire Team)

### Rebuttal Process

At CivicActions, we believe in openness and care, which extends to our performance evaluation process.

If you disagree with your review, you can engage in our rebuttal process:

#### 1. The "Cooling-off" Period

- **What It Is**: After receiving your review, you have 10 business days to thoroughly read and process the feedback.
- **Your Role**:
    - Take the time to reflect on the feedback with an open mind.
    - Identify specific points of disagreement and note why you disagree.
    - Create a copy of the [Rebuttal Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wFyNx33y68OgmAwmAPlaU6q_MFDcVSKblimbMCittHQ/edit?usp=sharing) and fill in with your content.

#### 2. Initial Discussion with the Reviewer

- **Purpose**: A one-on-one meeting with your manager to discuss your concerns.
- **Your Role**:
    - Schedule this meeting to promote open dialogue.
    - Approach the conversation constructively to clarify misunderstandings and address concerns.
    - If you feel uncomfortable with a one-on-one meeting, go directly to step 3.

#### 3. Written Rebuttal (If Necessary)

- **When to Use**: If the initial discussion doesn't resolve the issue, you can submit a formal written rebuttal.
- **Your Role**:
    - Email your rebuttal to PeopleOps.
    - Keep it concise, clearly identifying the aspects of the evaluation being disputed.
    - Focus on specific points of disagreement, providing evidence and alternative perspectives.

#### 4. Review Committee

- **Purpose**: To ensure a fair resolution by reviewing all documentation.
- **Process**:
    - A committee comprising a People Ops representative, the reviewer's manager, and, if applicable, the department director will review your rebuttal.
    - The committee will review the original review, your rebuttal, and meet with both you and the reviewer if needed.
    - They will make a recommendation on the review and any necessary adjustments to the rating.
- **Final Decision**: The CTO or COO will review the committee's recommendation and make the final decision.

#### 5. Communication of Final Decision

- **Your Role**:
    - Await the final decision to be communicated in writing by PeopleOps.
    - Use the feedback to refine your understanding and continue growing within your role.

### Tips for Navigating the Rebuttal Process

- **Take Your Time**: Use the cooling-off period to process your feedback thoroughly and avoid reacting impulsively. This will help you articulate your concerns more effectively.
- **Be Specific**: Focus on specific aspects of the evaluation that you disagree with. Clearly explain why, and provide examples or evidence to support your perspective.
- **Stay Professional**: Approach the process with a constructive attitude. Avoid making it personal and focus on resolving misunderstandings or discrepancies.
- **Prepare for Discussions**: If meeting with your reviewer, come prepared with notes and questions. This shows you're taking the process seriously and fosters productive dialogue.
- **Understand the Process**: Familiarize yourself with each step of the rebuttal process so you know what to expect and can prepare accordingly.
