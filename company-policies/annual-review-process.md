# Annual performance review

CivicActions uses Culture Amp to administer annual reviews. Culture Amp offers asynchronous, scalable review processes, including self reflection, peer feedback, and manager feedback.

## Value

As a company, we want to continuously move towards an open culture where we can give feedback early, often, and openly.
Our regular feedback and review cycles help us accomplish this. The process isn't cumbersome and the reviewee leaves with actionable and valuable feedback. It has also led to our entire team regularly getting practice in giving their peers and managers constructive feedback.

## How it works

We have an annual review season and reviews are delivered in the last two weeks of April. In Culture Amp, you will do a self reflection about the previous year and you will get peer feedback. Your manager will take that feedback and complete their review as well. Your manager will meet with you to discuss the feedback and any compensation changes and data about your hours and utilization over the past year.
