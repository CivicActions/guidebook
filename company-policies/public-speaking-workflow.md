# Public Speaking Workflow

1. The Speaker fills out the [Google intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgSaZBZGqpIqdelav1dtJNhzRirAtCTeCpg1J4KPuckuyXVw/viewform) with event details, draft materials, and the name of their Program and/or Project Manager. The form must be submitted as soon as the speaker decides to submit to present/talk at the event. Once the Google intake form is submitted, it's automatically routed to both Marketing and Legal. They should ping Marketing (Marissa), Legal (Allison), and their Program and/or Project Manager in the #marketing channel once the form is submitted.
1. Marketing summarizes the contents and shares a PDF of the request with the Program and/or Project Manager. Legal also reviews the submission and flags any contract or compliance issues that might come up.
1. Legal will coordinate with the Program and/or Project Manager on the drafting and delivery of any requests for approval or communications with the client that are required by the contract.
1. The Program and/or Project Manager sends the necessary request to the client, CC'ing Legal and the Speaker. Each client may have additional specific workflows that need to happen in order to obtain formal approval, and the Program and/or Project Manager will lead in making sure those are followed.
1. The Program and/or Project Manager keeps the process moving and makes sure client approval is received. Once it comes through, they update the Speaker, Marketing, and Legal. The approval must be captured in writing by the client for CivicActions records.
1. Once client approval to proceed is received, the client may ask to see additional outlines or final materials prior to the event. Any materials created should be reviewed by Marketing and the Program and/or Project Manager before submission to the client.
1. The Program and/or Project Manager sends the materials to the client, CC'ing the Speaker, following the required timeline. For example, CMS needs to approve final decks at least three weeks in advance. The Speaker should allow time for client edits or questions, thus submitting prior to a due date the client requests. Edits and questions will be directed to the Speaker, with support of the Program and/or Project Manager.
1. Ownership is shared: the Program and/or Project Manager keeps things on track and coordinates approvals, the Speaker prepares content and stays in the loop, Legal supports compliance, and Marketing reviews the deck prior to sending to client and helps manage the workflow, communication, and ensures that the final message reflects the CivicActions brand.
