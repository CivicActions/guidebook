## Hours of work

The normal workweek for a full-time employee is forty (40) hours. With some employees, there are set days and times, and with others there are no set days or times of day. You are expected to be available for and participate in necessary project-related work sessions, meetings, discussions, etc. Using your slack status to indicate if you are working or if you are away from your keyboard is appreciated and considered a best practice.

## Attendance / Tardiness

CivicActions trusts its employees. If an employee is unable to work for any reason, we just ask that you make a good faith effort to timely notify CivicActions of an absence or period of unavailability. If you are going to be late to a scheduled meeting, a slack ping to notify the meeting faciliator or the project channel with an ETA is appreciated and considered a best practice.

## Personal appearance

Be appropriate for the client you are meeting either face-to-face or via video conferencing. If you have any questions, you should contact your manager for suggestions.

## Access to business-related online accounts

Please tell the admin group about any online accounts you open for the benefit of CivicActions or a CivicActions client. Admin keeps all login information for these accounts so they can be easily accessed should changes need to be made.
