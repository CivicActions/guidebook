# Introductory Period (Intro Period)

When new team members join CivicActions, they enter a 90-day introductory period (intro period). During this time, they’ll get to know our culture and values, meet their team, adjust to our working style, and learn their role's responsibilities. While our interview process ensures a good fit based on skills and communication, this period helps us confirm alignment once they start.

This program is designed to provide support for success, with regular performance check-ins. At the 30-day mark, team members will be prompted to discuss their experience so far, ensure the role aligns with their expectations, and have a scheduled meeting with their manager to discuss progress. At the 60-day mark, People Operations will check in with both the team member and their manager to see if additional support is needed. At the 90-day mark, team members will complete a self-assessment, and their manager will provide a review.

Upon completion of the 90-day period, team members will gain access to their professional development fund and will receive their choice of company swag. Throughout the period, team members will regularly connect with someone from People Operations and their manager for guidance and feedback. Support isn’t limited to just these individuals—our collaborative team encourages input and assistance from others too.

During the Intro Period, all team members are at-will employees, and completing this period does not change that status.
