## At-Will Employment

Your employment with CivicActions is at-will, meaning it is not for a specific duration. You or the company may terminate the employment at any time, with or without cause or notice. This policy cannot be changed by any verbal or written statements, and no implied contract exists between you and the company based on this guidebook or any other document.

Only authorized management can modify policies in this Employee Guidebook, except for the "At-Will Employment" provision, which cannot be altered by anyone. This guidebook does not infringe upon your rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

## Equal Employment Opportunity

CivicActions is committed to equal employment opportunities for all team members and applicants. We do not discriminate based on age, race, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, medical conditions, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by law. We take allegations of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation seriously and will investigate when necessary.

## Reasonable Accommodations

CivicActions complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and applicable state laws. We will not discriminate against team members with disabilities and will make reasonable accommodations to help them perform their job duties, as long as it does not cause undue hardship to the company.

## Exempt vs. Non-Exempt

Exempt- Team members who meet specific criteria under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and are not entitled to overtime pay. This includes managers and certain office staff.

Non-exempt- Team members who do not meet the FLSA criteria and are entitled to overtime pay for hours worked beyond the standard workweek.

## Confidentiality

Team members should exercise discretion when handling confidential information, as outlined in the "Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement" signed at the time of hire.

## Outside Activities

Team members may engage in outside work or educational activities during non-working hours, provided these activities do not interfere with job performance or create a conflict of interest.

## Performance Support Plan Process

Team members are expected to maintain high job performance and ethical behavior. If performance does not meet expectations, team members may be placed on a Performance Support Plan.
The Performance Support Plan is designed to help team members improve in areas where their performance may not meet expectations. The plan outlines specific areas for improvement, sets clear action items, and provides structured support and feedback. Over the course of the plan, the team member will receive guidance and have regular check-ins to track progress.

Key elements of the plan include:

Performance Concerns- The team member will focus on improving specific issues, such as communication, time tracking, and asking for help when blocked on tasks.

Action Items- Detailed tasks, including updating tickets, requesting support when needed, and keeping timesheets current, will be part of the improvement process.

Meetings- The team member is expected to attend only essential meetings during the support period, with guidance on which ones to prioritize.

Check-ins and Reviews- The team member will have regular check-ins with their manager, and after the course of the plan, a formal review will be conducted to assess progress.

The goal of this plan is to provide team members with the support needed to reach their full potential and ensure their success in their role.
Ongoing challenges in improvement may require additional support or corrective action. We expect all team members to adhere to company procedures and align with CivicActions' values, and any behavior that deviates from these expectations may result in further discussion or action.

## Reporting Irregularities

Team members are responsible for reporting any suspected irregularities, such as fraud or theft, to a member of the management team.

## Conflict of Interest

If you believe there is a conflict of interest, either within the company or related to outside activities, discuss it with your manager. You can also refer to the full [Conflict of Interest Policy](https://guidebook.civicactions.com/en/latest/company-policies/employment/us/employment/#conflict-of-interest) for more details.

## Background Checks

CivicActions may verify prior employment, check professional references, and confirm educational background before extending an offer. In some cases, security checks may be required for specific clients.

## Immigration Law Compliance

Team members hired to work in the U.S. must complete Form I-9 and provide proof of eligibility to work. These documents will be stored confidentially in the team member's personnel file.

## Employment Classifications

Team members should notify the People Operations team of any changes to personal information, such as address or phone number, to ensure records are updated.
