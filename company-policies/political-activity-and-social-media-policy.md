# CivicActions Political Activity and Social Media Policy

## Purpose

CivicActions respects and supports Team Members' rights to engage in political speech, social media, and activism outside of their professional responsibilities. This policy aims to provide guidance on balancing personal expression with CivicActions' commitment to nonpartisanship in political matters, particularly given our work on government contracts.

## Policy Guidelines

### Personal Political Activity

-   Team Members are free to participate in political activities, protests, and advocacy in their personal capacity.
-   Team Members should not imply or state that CivicActions or its clients endorse their personal political views.
-   Team Members should avoid direct association between CivicActions and political causes in public forums, media appearances, or other public statements.
-   When engaging in political activities, Team Members should avoid wearing company-branded apparel or using company-affiliated materials.

### Social Media Conduct

-   Team Members may express their personal opinions on social media but should not imply or state that CivicActions or its clients endorses their opinions.
-   Posts that directly or indirectly tie political viewpoints to CivicActions, whether through explicit language or professional affiliation, should be reviewed to ensure political neutrality.

### LinkedIn-Specific Policy

-   Team Members should ensure that political statements on LinkedIn do not imply CivicActions' endorsement or affiliation.
-   When discussing political topics on LinkedIn, Team Members should use neutral and professional language to avoid potential conflicts with this policy.
-   Team Members may be asked to modify LinkedIn posts that could be perceived as partisan, particularly if their profile prominently features their CivicActions role.

By following these guidelines, we aim to maintain a workplace that respects individual rights while ensuring CivicActions' integrity and reputation remain intact. This policy may be updated periodically to reflect evolving legal and contractual obligations.
