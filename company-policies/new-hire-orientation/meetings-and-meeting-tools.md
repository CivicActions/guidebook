# Meetings

## Your Own Events

Remember that you can book time on your own calendar. We recommend blocking off your own "heads down" time in two-to-four hour chunks to complete tasks. You should also block off times where you don't want to get booked for meetings (eg a doctor's appt or long lunch with a friend).

Also, if you're planning a meeting, be sure to state your goal (what the meeting is and what it isn't) in an agenda and invite description.

## All Humans Calls (AHC)

Our AHCs include everyone across CivicActions. They are one of the ways the team shares news, updates, appreciations and congratulations. They take place monthly on Mondays at 10am PT / 1pm ET and Fridays at 1pm PT / 3pm ET. You aren't required to attend the AHCs, but you are strongly encouraged to – it's where big announcements are made, and attending is a great way to put names to faces. The agenda is posted beforehand in [#announcements](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/announcements) and chatter during and following the call happens in [#ahc](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/ahc). You can submit ideas for future Monday AHCs to the marketing team or your manager. Upcoming AHCs are announced in the [#announcements](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/announcements) channel.
