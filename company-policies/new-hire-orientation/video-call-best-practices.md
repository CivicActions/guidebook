title: Video Call Best Practices
---

-   Be on time - please! Seconds matter.
-   Add a photo to your account, so it shows up if your camera is off.
-   Zoom has added a pronoun field. Please fill this in so that people are confident that they can communicate with you respectfully. These can be configured on https://zoom.us/profile
-   We use the chat and screen sharing features. For certain calls like AHC we use Slack for chats so that folks who are watching a recording can participate also. Discussions in Slack are preserved and searchable, unlike those in Zoom.
-   Turn off your camera or reduce bandwidth if the connection is poor.
-   Use a headset or headphones instead of relying solely on the computer mic (computer mics can sometimes create echoes).
-   Use your best judgment for video call dress, backgrounds, and effects. Most people turn off their video (face-mute) when eating.
-   It's okay to mute others or ask them to mute themselves. It is a best practice to mute if primarily listening to a discussion.
-   Be sure to let people know if you expect noise in your location and that you will be muting when not talkingâ€”dogs, construction, etc.
-   When you see people talking who are on mute, it is a best practice to let them know.
-   We can invite people outside of CivicActions.
-   If someone hears an echo & you don't, then your computer is likely creating the echo. Try using headphones or plugging them in again.
-   When appropriate and a screen isn't technically needed to be on a call, it's okay to face-mute and go for a walk or do another activity while listening or engaging in the discussion. Zoom has a mobile app that you can use for this purpose. Please let people know if you are doing this.

## Video Preference Considerations

-   We wish to host the most inclusive and welcoming spaces for all. Therefore, please use the camera option that works best for you.
-   If you are comfortable with your camera on, then we encourage you to do so. However, turning cameras on is not required - we recognize that it does not work for everyone, which is ok.
-   Don't assume that someone is less interested if their camera is off. Be aware that it may be a way for them to stay focused.
-   Don't assume someone can recognize emotional content through words and vocal inflection alone.
-   Some teams find that turning off their video after folks have settled in can help build trust and form deeper connections. Having a wall of faces to engage with can be draining and distracting.

## Zoom fatigue

[Zoom fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_fatigue) is real, and we recommend that teams and individuals find ways to reduce the number or duration of meetings and calls. For example, if someone isn't getting value from a call, provide clear expectations and space for them to let the host or inviter know this and skip the meeting in the future.
