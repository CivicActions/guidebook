# CivicActions' Elevator Pitch

Are you prepared for the "so, what does _your_ company do" questions? Having an elevator pitch in mind is useful, not just for conferences, but also for every day networking.

Think about when you're at a gathering and you're excited about your new job and someone asks you to tell them more... what will you say? Don't sweat it, be prepared!

Here's a sample:

> them: What do you do?

> me: We are fixing our government.

> them: Huh?

> me: Have you read about the opioid crisis?

> them: Yeah...

> me: Well, one of our clients is the federal agency CMS. For CMS, we help them make data available on the financial relationship between drug manufactures and physicians. This makes it possible for non profits and journalists to study the links between payments to physicians by manufacturers. We are also helping veterans by making it easy to get support when they need it most.

> me: The vision, in short, is to make our world work great for everyone. We focus on improving government. I personally am doing...
