# Expenses

CivicActions will reimburse approved, business-related, and out-of-pocket expenses within 30 days, as long as you submit a receipt.

If you are an employee based in Canada, refer to the pinned Slack instructions for submitting an expense in the [#ca-canada-employees channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/ca-canada-employees/) in Slack.

## Request approval for an expense

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
_Before incurring an expense_ the cost should be estimated and approved by your manager. The exception to this is [prodev expenses of less than $50](../employee-benefits/professional-development.md#your-prodev-budget), which do not require approval.

## To request approval in Unanet

1.  Unanet > Homepage > Scroll down to +Expense Request (be careful not to click +Expense Report)
2.  Complete info on screen
3.  Click on Details
4.  Complete info on screen (Wizard screen will appear when you click on the amount)
5.  For Wizard screen: You do NOT need to add a receipt for the Request.
6.  SUBMIT

IMPORTANT NOTE: when your expense Request is approved, Unanet automatically changes it to an expense Report that will be on your Unanet homepage until you submit it. You will not receive a notification that this has occurred, so please check your homepage regularly after you submit a Request so you know when it has been approved.

## Expense guidelines

- Treat company money like it is your own money, use it to work smarter and spend it with wisdom and care.
- Please book as early as possible - for flights and accommodation this can make a big difference!
- Consider AirBnB instead of hotels. If you are unsure of how many people can attend, getting a slightly larger AirBnB ahead of time is normally better than waiting and getting an AirBnB or hotel rooms last minute.
- Your Project Manager and the Officer Manager will provide information about what is or isn't reimbursable. For example, if you prefer first class for a flight or want to add a leg for a vacation, then that wouldn't be reimbursable but the amount for an economy class return would.
- Reduce your footprint when possible and use public transit or shared Lyft Lines instead of single occupancy rides.
- If you are purchasing multiple "under $50" items in a short timespan, please consider that a single purchase and request approval first.
