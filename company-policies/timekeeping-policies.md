## 4 —Timekeeping
### 4.1	Timesheet Entry
For All Team Members, CivicActions uses the Unanet integrated timekeeping system, which is managed by the Accounting Department. Access to Unanet is username and password restricted and requires a specific number of hours per day/week/period depending upon the arrangement with the Team Member. 

***Workforce Management***

When a new Team Member is hired, the hiring team and People Ops team notify the Resource Planning Analyst (RPA) who assigns the Team Member to required internal projects and tasks in Unanet. The RPA asks the Project Manager to assign the Team Member to required client projects and tasks. For Team Members not considered new hires, requests for access to particular projects and tasks are made via Slack (#unanet channel) and are reviewed by either the RPA, the Project Manager or other personnel with the Resource Assigner role in Unanet.
### 4.2	Timesheet Corrections
Timesheet corrections are primarily initiated by the Team Member or their Manager. Team Members are responsible for making all timesheet corrections prior to the timesheet period being closed. If the corrections pertain to a prior closed period, the Team Member must coordinate the corrections with the Accounting Department and Program Finance for the timecard to be administratively adjusted. The Resource and Planning Analyst (A Unanet Administrator) makes the necessary corrective adjustment and adds an explanation as to why the correction is needed. Once the Team Member’s Manager approves the corrected timesheet, the Resource and Planning Analyst extracts the corrected timesheets, reviews for any cost adjustments that will need to be accounted for in the following payroll and notifies the Controller. The Controller posts the labor distribution in the accounting system.
### 4.3	Timekeeping Special Circumstances
In certain instances, People & Operations can input time on a Team Member’s behalf and sign the timesheet at the Team Member’s request. The timesheet will be reviewed and approved by the Manager. This is only done in rare circumstances where the Team Member does not have reasonable access to complete the timesheet, on time on their own, or is on special leave. People & Operations documents the reason for completing the timesheet within the timesheet comments and the Manager reviews and approves. The Team Member must review and approve the timesheet upon returning to work. 
### 4.4	General Leave
All CivicActions’ Team Members are expected to record all vacation, holiday, or other leave into the timekeeping system.

***Paid Time Off***

Paid time off (PTO) is managed in accordance with the PTO policy. Leave eligibility is handled by the People Department. The tracking and review of PTO is performed by Managers and the People Department. 

***Holiday***

Eligible Team Members are entitled to Holiday pay and associated Office Closing pay as defined in the Benefits policy. Team Members are expected to record all applicable Holiday time to the corresponding Holiday project charge code, within the timekeeping system. The Accounting Department reviews the holiday code usage on a semi-monthly basis, to ensure proper usage of the code.
