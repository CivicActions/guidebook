# BLOOM EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK

This Handbook has been prepared to describe Bloom's philosophy, working methods and processes, employment practices, policies, benefits, and the conduct we expect from members of our team.

## This is not really the README you are looking for.

The main handbook README is located at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md), which gets synced to readthedocs at <https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/>.
