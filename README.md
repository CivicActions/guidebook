# BLOOM EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK

This Handbook has been prepared to describe Bloom's philosophy, working methods and processes, employment practices, policies, benefits, and the conduct we expect from members of our team.

## This is not really the README you are looking for.

The main handbook README is located at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md), which gets synced to readthedocs at <https://bloom-handbook.readthedocs.io/>.

## Temporary Notes from Sofia 03/1/2021
Draft folder contains policy that either (1) I'm not sure to adopt, (2) are outside of my expertise, (3) need to be reviewed. Not a great process at the moment so please forgive the mess. I'm working on it!
