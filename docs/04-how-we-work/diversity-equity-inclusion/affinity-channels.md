# Affinity Channels

## What is an affinity channel?

Affinity channels are intentional spaces for people who share a common identity or affinity (and thier allies) to build community and have conversations that are harder to protect in a general space. For example, the `#ca-womxn` affinity channel is a space for CivicActioners who identify as female, trans, gender non-conforming, and allies.

## Who can join an affinity channel

Please honor the intentions of the affinity channels by only joining affinity groups you feel you can constructively participate in. For open channels, be aware that conversations are public and can be viewed by anyone at CivicActions, regardless of whether or not they are in the channel.

Anyone can join an affinity channel, including members of the management team. Management members who are not in the affinity channels do not monitor private channels but reserves the right to view content in channels that are private.

All affinity channels, private and public, are open to allies of the affinity group. Allies are individuals who do not necessarily share the characteristics of members of the affinity group but share the goals of that affinity channel.

## Affinity channel moderator role

Affinity channel moderators serve as the main point of contact for team members outside of private channels. Moderators are responsible for adding new team members to the channel on request. Each private affinity channel must have at least one designated moderator, but they do not have to be the person who created the channel. Moderators of channels are responsible for monitoring the channel compliance with all company policies including CivicActions' Code of Conduct and CivicActions' Policy Against Proscribed Harassment and Discrimination. Moderator's are responsible for (a) actively monitor the channel and (b) immediately reporting any actual or suspected violations of company policies to a member of the PeopleOps team. Reports of violations of company policy may be made privately by direct message or by email.
