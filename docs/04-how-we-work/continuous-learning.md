# Continuous Learning

CivicActions is a learning organization, stemming from our organizational belief in the continuous learning
principles of Agile. All work that each of us performs presents opportunities for continuous learning. We aim 
to learn from one another and share our knowledge back to make the world better.

## Project Learning

Projects are defined in broad context to capture any sort of work performed within the team. This could be a 
development project for a client, writing a sales proposal, a marketing initiative, or even professional development
activities.

Our Scrum teams hold retrospectives to make continuous improvements based on what is learned during projects.
Projects can iteratively make changes that improve efficiency, operations, and much more. This approach encourages 
team members to learn, grow, and experiment in ways to more effectively serve our customers without fear of 
failure. More information is provided on the [retrospectives](https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook/blob/master/docs/04-how-we-work/agile-baseline/02-process/practices/sprint-retrospectives.md) 
page. 

## Organizational Learning

As we work, retrospectives may identify considerations or improvements outside of projects that generally affect how 
we work. Commonly, this applies to a department, like Delivery, Marketing, Sales, Administrative, or Engineering. 

Each group has their own process for reviewing feedback. 

Some groups are leveraging Holacracy and Agile Guild concepts as a framework for organizational learning. This is akin 
to providing an interface for our team members to share thoughts with the broader organization. More details can be 
found on the [Holacracy](/docs/04-how-we-work/holacracy.md) page.

## Providing Feedback

Each group maintains their own process for soliciting feedback, which is detailed below. Considerations to form a group 
can be found [here](/docs/04-how-we-work/holacracy.md).

### Sales

Sales is leveraging [holacracy concepts](/docs/07-sales-and-marketing/sales-guild.md) with a monthly Guild meeting (governance meeting) and a Trello board that serves 
as a rolling agenda. Any member of the team can join the monthly meeting found on the Sales calendar and populate items 
within the Trello board.

### Marketing

TO DO

### Delivery

Delivery has a weekly PM meeting and also maintains a "PM Snuggle Struggles" Trello board.
 
### Engineering

Engineering holds a bi-weekly Festivus-style meeting. One part of the meeting is the "airing of grievances" which can 
serve as a means of discussing potential feedback. Engineering maintains a GitHub repository that stores all agendas for
 these bi-weekly meetings.
 
### Management

Management holds a weekly ops call for those on the management team. To provide feedback, please use Slack to 
communicate directly with Elizabeth, Owen, Bill, Aaron, or Henry accordingly.
