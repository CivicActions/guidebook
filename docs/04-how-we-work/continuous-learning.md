# Continuous Learning

## Background

CivicActions is a learning organization, stemming from our organizational belief in the continuous learning
principles of Agile. All work that each of us performs presents opportunities for continuous learning. We aim 
to learn from one another and share our knowledge back to make the world better. We believe in a relatively 
flat organizational structure that empowers all of our team members to participate in helping CivicActions 
reach it's fullest potential in the world.

Many organizations operate in silos, as the following image represents:

Silos often create challenges around openness and discourage broader participation from all members of the organization.
 At CivicActions, openness is in our value system and we believe every member of our team should be able to participate in 
 most aspects of the organization. We aim to offer tools to help improve our organization and our projects based on 
 what we learn.
 
Agile teams (projects, proposals, labs, prodev, etc) generate improvements through actual work. We desire orthogonal 
structures that harness organizational feedback from all of the Agile teams. This concept is represented 
by the following visual:

Such a structure allows for any Agile team to have a framework for sharing their learning back with the 
organization.
 
### Project Learning

Projects are defined in broad context to capture any sort of work performed within the team. This could be a 
development project for a client, writing a sales proposal, a marketing initiative, or even professional development
activities. 

### Organizational Learning

As we work, team members may identify considerations or improvements outside of projects that generally affect how 
we work. Team members may organically come up with ideas that they want to share with CivicActions. We aim to provide 
a practice for harnessing and discussing ideas within the organization. We explored frameworks like Holacracy 
and Agile Guilds, which provide interfaces for team members to share thoughts with the broader organization. These 
concepts motivated our implementation, which is described in the practices section of this page.

## Practices

This section articulates our practices for continuous learning within our organization.

## Improvements
Improvements represent opportunities that stem from the work we do to facilitate discussion and next steps toward 
organizational clarity. In our Agile process, improvements most directly relates to ideas or feedback that come from 
retrospectives. Holacracy uses the term "tensions" for this concept. We have chosen "improvements".

### Retrospectives

Our Scrum teams hold retrospectives to identify both organizational and project improvements based on 
the work performed during projects. Projects can iteratively make changes that improve efficiency, operations, 
and much more. This approach encourages team members to learn, grow, and experiment in ways to more effectively serve 
our customers without fear of failure. More information is provided on the 
[retrospectives](agile-baseline/02-process/practices/sprint-retrospectives.md) page.

### Governance Meetings and Agile Guilds
Organizational improvements require an orthogonal structure that provides a well-defined interface that collects and 
organizes improvements combined with a forum for discussing next steps. Holacracy offers the concept of a Governance 
Meeting to achieve these goals. CivicActions requires something that is closer aligned with our current Agile practices. 
The concept of an Agile Guild offers similar motivations to that of a Governance Meeting, but offers a structure that 
more closely aligns with our Agile team retrospectives and the improvements that arises.
