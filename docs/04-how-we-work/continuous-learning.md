# Continuous Learning

CivicActions is a learning organization, stemming from our organizational belief in the continuous learning
principles of Agile. All work that each of us performs presents opportunities for continuous learning. We aim 
to learn from one another and share our knowledge back to make the world better.

## Project Learning

Projects are defined in broad context to capture any sort of work performed within the team. This could be a 
development project for a client, writing a sales proposal, a marketing initiative, or even professional development
activities.

Our Scrum teams hold retrospectives to make continuous improvements based on what is learned during projects.
Projects can iteratively make changes that improve efficiency, operations, and much more. This approach encourages 
team members to learn, grow, and experiment in ways to more effectively serve our customers without fear of 
failure. More information is provided on the [retrospectives](agile-baseline/02-process/practices/sprint-retrospectives.md) 
page. 

## Organizational Learning

As we work, retrospectives may identify considerations or improvements outside of projects that generally affect how 
we work. Team members may organically come up with ideas that they want to share with CivicActions. We aim to provide 
a framework for harnessing and discussing their ideas within the organization.

We have split feedback into groups to afford more focused discussions. Some groups are leveraging Holacracy and Agile 
Guild concepts as a framework for organizational learning. This is akin to providing an interface for our team members 
to share thoughts with the broader organization. More details can be found on the 
[Holacracy](/docs/04-how-we-work/holacracy.md) page. 

Each group maintains their own process for soliciting feedback, which is described below. Considerations to form a group 
can be found [here](/docs/04-how-we-work/holacracy.md).

### Departments

All continuous learning practices are maintained department-by-department. Many of the departments are leveraging 
Holacracy and Guild concepts to collect tensions, review during a governance meeting, and define outcomes.

More information can be found on each department from the [department listing](../02-about-us/departments.md).

### Services

Each of our [services](../02-about-us/services) could be candidates for their own guilds. But, as a small team 
with limited resources, we may not have the broad participation desired for guilds. 

As an alternative, services could be affiliated with departmental governance meetings. Tensions can be raised that 
may relate to a specific services. Collaboration can happen during the meeting and outcomes determined, which may include 
follow up actions or further discussion pertinent to the service.

### Working Groups

CivicActions can create [working groups](../02-about-us/working-groups) that pertain to initiatives or efforts as the 
need arises. For example, the Documentation Working Group has formed as an effort to capture CivicActions knowledge. 
Each working group maintains it's own learning process, but often resembles Guilds in that there are periodic meetings 
and often a Trello board to track and maintain efforts.
