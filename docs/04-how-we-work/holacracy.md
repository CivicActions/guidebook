# Holacracy

While CivicActions does not practice Holacracy to it's fullest degree, we maintain some shared motivations. First, 
we believe in a relatively flat organizational structure that empowers all of our team members to participate in 
helping CivicActions reach it's fullest potential in the world. Holacracy provides some concepts we leverage 
as-needed to help provide a framework for shared organizational understanding.

Many organizations operate in silos, as the following image represents:

Silos often create challenges around openness and discourage broader participation from all members of the organization.
 At CivicActions, openness is in our values and we believe every member of our team should be able to participate in 
 most aspects of the organization. As such, we see some of the tools and concepts used in Holacracy as a means for 
promoting participation in an open organization.

## Roles and Accountabilities
In Holacracy terms, every individual is assigned one or more roles. Each role has a set of accountabilities that help 
clarify the expectations and/or responsibilities of the role. At CivicActions, we have both organizational and project 
roles. For instance, we have a CEO, VP of Sales, and a Director of Professional Services that are organizational roles. 
Projects maintain roles like Scrum Master, Tech Lead, and Engineer to help clarify an individual's involvement. 

Having clarity on roles and accountabilities offers a framework for continuous learning. For example, if feedback is 
raised during a retrospective that someone was not aware that he/she was expected to perform a function, this framework 
offers a logical way to define this information.

Both organizational and project-specific roles are organized by their respective group.

1. [Delivery roles]()
1. [Marketing roles]()
1. [Administrative roles]()
1. [Management roles]()

## Tensions
The concept of a tension initially sounds like conflict, but this is Holacracy terminology that most directly 
relates to ideas or feedback that come from retrospectives. Tensions represent opportunities that stem from the work 
we do to facilitate discussion on continuous improvement or organizational clarity.

## Governance Meetings and Agile Guilds
Tensions require both a well-defined interface to collect and organize tensions and a forum for discussing next steps. 
Holacracy offers the concept of a Governance Meeting to achieve these goals. Since CivicActions is not 
leveraging the full breadth of Holacracy, we require something that is closer aligned with our current practices.

The concept of an Agile Guild offers similar motivations to that of a Governance Meeting, but offers concepts that 
more closely align with our Agile teams and feedback that arises from retrospectives. Agile teams (projects, proposals, 
labs, prodev, etc) generate tensions through actual work. Agile Guilds are orthogonal to this work, as the 
motivation of a guild is to harness organizational feedback from all of the Agile teams. This concept is represented 
by the following visual:

![Agile Guilds and Agile Teams](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Nk9G_KFq6gMGOLMxZTM3rQ.png)

This type of structure allows for any Agile team to have a framework for sharing their learning back with the 
organization.

### Guild Directory

At CivicActions, each group would have their own respective guild (or similar concept) that highlights their own 
specific guild operations. This affords opportunities to have specific best practices on a group-by-group basis, but
 also the opportunity to allow team members to only join the guild meetings aligned with their interests.
 
1. [Sales Guild](/docs/07-sales-and-marketing/sales-guild.md) - #sales - Monthly Sales Retrospective - Members: Bill, Adam, Steve, Susie, Gerardo
1. [Marketing Guild]() - #marketing - Daily Marketing Scrum - Members: Aaron, Luke
1. [Engineering Guild]() - #engineering - Bi-weekly Engineering Meeting - Members: Owen, Dave, Adam
1. [Delivery Guild]() - #pm - Weekly PM Meeting - Members: Elizabeth, Alaine
1. [Administrative Guild]() - #general - As needed - Members: Henry, Judy
1. [Management Guild]() - private slack channel - Weekly Ops call - Members: Henry, Aaron, Elizabeth, Owen, Bill

Please note that both meetings and information may be deemed private if sensitive information is raised. This will be 
managed by the respective guild on a case-by-case basis.

### Governance of a Guild

* Meet regularly and schedule recurring meetings with screen sharing on open, shared calendars
* Keep up-to-date meeting notes on Trello cards, e-mail lists, and/or Slack channel
* Announce meetings at least one hour before hand to encourage participation
* Participate in project retrospectives as needed, capture feedback into Guild
* Use the established forums as the primary means of working, communicating, and collaborating, as opposed to private emails and meetings
* Update evolved guild operations in the documentation handbook

### Creating a Guild
* Establish Trello board (or organizational tool), e-mail list, and slack channel
* Identify base membership
* Create a set of best practices to run your guild meetings (prioritizing issues, capturing outcomes, assignment of tasks)
* Capture guild operations in the documentation handbook

### Guild roles
1. **Lead**: Organizer, decision maker (tie breaker)
1. **Facilitator**: Shares screen and facilitates the guild meetings
1. **Member**: Regular attendee
1. **Participant**: Attends regular guild meetings and participates in discussion
1. **Secretary**: Takes notes, organizes recurring meetings, communication 

### Guild outcomes
Outcomes are determined through discussion during the routine guild meeting. Any outcome is fine (even none), but 
the following opportunities could be considered:

1. Update the documentation handbook
1. Engage other guilds by adding cards or feedback to other boards
1. Create or update a lab or pro dev activity
1. Create or update a guild
1. Create or update a service
1. Create or update organizational roles/accountabilities
