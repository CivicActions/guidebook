# Workplace Guidelines

## Hours of Work

The normal workweek for a full-time employee is forty (40) hours. With some employees, there are set days and times, and with others there are no set days or times of day. You are expected to be available for and participate in necessary project-related work sessions, hangouts, discussions, etc.

## Attendance / Tardiness

Bloom Works trusts its employees. If an employee is unable to work for any reason, we just ask that you make a good faith effort to timely notify Bloom Works of an absence or period of unavailability.

## Personal Appearance

Be appropriate for the client you are meeting either face-to-face or via video conferencing. If you have any questions, you should contact your manager for suggestions.

## Access to Business-Related Online Accounts

Please tell the admin group about any online accounts you open for the benefit of Bloom Works or a Bloom Works client. Admin keeps all login information for these accounts so they can be easily accessed should changes need to be made.
