# Professional Development and Community Participation

## Background - the Why

Here at Bloom Works we believe in living our values, not just saying them. Creating the Professional Development stipend demonstrates our commitment to our staff and building equity, and opportunity, into the working experience at Bloom. 

We value Professional Development and Community Participation for a number of reasons:

- **Professional Development increases your skills which can result in increased revenue opportunities for CivicActions and higher salary for you**

- **Professional Development provides career mobility for each person - increasing our feeling of safety, which leads to:**

  - Having the courage to fail - which leads to experimentation, innovation, and learning
  - Having the courage to challenge the status quo - which leads to organizational learning
  - Having the courage to be vulnerable - which leads to authentic communications and connection
  - Open minded thinking - which leads to increased tolerance of others ideas and personality styles

- **Community Participation provides numerous benefits, including:**

  - Strengthened relationships with experts that can help when we are stuck
  - Career advancement opportunities (potential new employment offers) for each of us, which increases our feeling of safety
  - Opportunities to increase the impact of the work being done by our entire industry - which helps with our mission to transform the way professional services are delivered in government
  - Opportunities for CivicActions to popularize the idea of radical openness, which strengthens our brand
