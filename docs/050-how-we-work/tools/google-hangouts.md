# Google Meet (formerly Google Hangouts)

## Google Meet v Zoom

While Zoom is our default video meeting zoom, there are a few use cases for using Google Meet.

- If your Zoom meeting is being used by another team member when you want to video meet with someone else, you can create a Google Meet call
- Some clients can access Google products but cannot use Zoom, so your team may default to Google Meet in those cases
- There is no time limit length for Google Meet calls (wheres as Zoom has limits for the basic users)
- With both Google Meet and Zoom, you can share the meeting info (link and dial in info), but with Google Meet you can dial someone into the call yourself
- In Zoom, only the meeting host (or co-hosts) can mute others, but in Google Meet anyone can mute anyone

## Google Meet Specifics

- Use Google Meet video chats in the browser (no download needed
- **You can add a Google Meet to a meeting invite** by clicking "Add conferencing" on the event management page.
- **You can also start or share a Google Meet from Slack** by typing `/hangout`
- **You can dial people into a Google Meet call.**
- A Google Meet invite dialog can generate a phone number that people can call

## Video Call Best Practices

- Be on time - please! Seconds matter.
- Add a photo to your account, so it shows up if your camera is off.
- Zoom has added a pronoun field. Please fill this in so that people are confident that they can communicate with you respectfully. These can be configured on https://zoom.us/profile
- We use the chat and screen sharing features. For certain calls like AHC we use Slack for chats so that folks who are watching a recording can participate also. Discussions in Slack are preserved and searchable, unlike those in Zoom.
- Turn off your camera or reduce bandwidth if the connection is poor.
- Use a headset or headphones instead of relying solely on the computer mic (computer mics can sometimes create echoes).
- Use your best judgment for video call dress, backgrounds, and effects. Most people turn off their video (face-mute) when eating. 
- It's okay to mute others or ask them to mute themselves. It is a best practice to mute if primarily listening to a discussion. 
- Be sure to let people know if you expect noise in your location and that you will be muting when not talking—dogs, construction, etc.
- When you see people talking who are on mute, it is a best practice to let them know. 
- We can invite people outside of CivicActions.
- If someone hears an echo & you don't, then your computer is likely creating the echo. Try using headphones or plugging them in again.
- When appropriate and a screen isn't technically needed to be on a call, it's okay to face-mute and go for a walk or do another activity while listening or engaging in the discussion. Zoom has a mobile app that you can use for this purpose. Please let people know if you are doing this.

## Video Preference Considerations

- We wish to host the most inclusive and welcoming spaces for all. Therefore, please use the camera option that works best for you.
- If you are comfortable with your camera on, then we encourage you to do so. However,  turning cameras on is not required - we recognize that it does not work for everyone, which is ok.
- Don't assume that someone is less interested if their camera is off.  Be aware that it may be a way for them to stay focused.
- Don't assume someone can recognize emotional content through words and vocal inflection alone.
- Some teams find that turning off their video after folks have settled in can help build trust and form deeper connections. Having a wall of faces to engage with can be draining and distracting. 

## Zoom fatigue

[Zoom fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_fatigue) is real, and we recommend that teams and individuals find ways to reduce the number or duration of meetings and calls. For example, if someone isn’t getting value from a call, provide clear expectations and space for them to let the host or inviter know this and skip the meeting in the future.
