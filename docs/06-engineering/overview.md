# Engineering

Engineers are (1) humans who (2) code. These attributes have a lot of overlap. We try to focus on the (1) things in `team` and the (2) things in `tech` documentation. Here at Bloom, you are more than the project you are working on. (2)-wise, that means we strive for generalists who can plug into whatever technical challenge comes up with gusto. (1)-wise, it means we care about your input, strategy, and satisfaction here.
