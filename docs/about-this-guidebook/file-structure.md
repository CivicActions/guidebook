# Guidebook file structure

The only files in the root directory of the repo (above docs/) are configuration files and the main repo README.md, which is what you find at <https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook>.

Within the docs folder, the folder and file structure is based on internal research on business and employee needs.

Folders and file names should all be lowercase and avoid special characters, except for hyphens (in place of spaces).
