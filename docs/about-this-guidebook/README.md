# How and when to contribute to the guidebook

This guidebook is written by and for all employees of CivicActions. Everyone is encouraged to contribute to continuously improve it.

The most common incentive to create or edit documentation is to "scratch an itch" that's felt when we come across a lack of information, or lack of standards around a practice. If you find a hole in the documentation, you're probably the best person to take a stab at filling it.

We also have [a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZKx6l4bC/civicactions-documentation-project) to manage the documentation backlog. Feel free to pick something off the backlog to work on.

We also use the [#docs](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/docs/) channel in Slack to communicate.

## Minimal Viable Contribution

Better than doing nothing at all:

- [Open a Trello card](https://trello.com/b/ZKx6l4bC/civicactions-documentation-project) with a documentation suggestion, or
- Create an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook/issues/new).
- Chat about it in [#docs](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/docs/).

## Writing documentation

You should read the rest of this section if you intend to contribute beyond a Trello ticket, issue, or chatting in the #docs channel.
