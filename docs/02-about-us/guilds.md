# Agile Guilds

As [described in our continous learning page](../04-how-we-work/continuous-learning.md), CivicActions leverages the 
concept of an Agile Guild to harness organizational feedback from team members and project retrospectives.

## Governance of a Guild

* Meet regularly and schedule recurring meetings with screen sharing on open, shared calendars
* Keep up-to-date meeting notes on Trello cards, e-mail lists, and/or Slack channel
* Announce meetings at least one hour before hand to encourage participation
* Participate in project retrospectives as needed, capture feedback into Guild
* Use the established forums as the primary means of working, communicating, and collaborating, as opposed to private emails and meetings
* Update evolved guild operations in the documentation handbook

## Creating a Guild
* Establish Trello board (or organizational tool), e-mail list, and slack channel
* Identify base membership
* Create a set of best practices to run your guild meetings (prioritizing issues, capturing outcomes, assignment of tasks)
* Capture guild operations in the documentation handbook

## Guild roles
1. **Lead**: Organizer, decision maker (tie breaker)
1. **Facilitator**: Shares screen and facilitates the guild meetings
1. **Member**: Regular attendee
1. **Participant**: Attends regular guild meetings and participates in discussion
1. **Secretary**: Takes notes, organizes recurring meetings, communication 

## Guild outcomes
Outcomes are determined through discussion during the routine guild meeting. Any outcome is fine (even none), but 
the following opportunities could be considered:

1. Update the documentation handbook
1. Engage other guilds by adding cards or feedback to other boards
1. Create or update a pro dev activity
1. Create or update a guild
1. Create or update a service
1. Create or update organizational roles/accountabilities
