# Agile Guilds

As [described in our continous learning page](../04-how-we-work/continuous-learning.md), CivicActions leverages the 
concept of an Agile Guild to harness organizational feedback from team members and project retrospectives.

Please note that both meetings and information may be deemed private if sensitive information is raised. This will be 
managed by the respective guild on a case-by-case basis.

## Governance of a Guild

* Meet regularly and schedule recurring meetings with screen sharing on open, shared calendars
* Keep up-to-date meeting notes on Trello cards, e-mail lists, and/or Slack channel
* Announce meetings at least one hour before hand to encourage participation
* Participate in project retrospectives as needed, capture feedback into Guild
* Use the established forums as the primary means of working, communicating, and collaborating, as opposed to private emails and meetings
* Update evolved guild operations in the documentation handbook

## Creating a Guild
* Establish Trello board (or organizational tool), e-mail list, and slack channel
* Identify base membership
* Create a set of best practices to run your guild meetings (prioritizing issues, capturing outcomes, assignment of tasks)
* Capture guild operations in the documentation handbook

## Guild roles
1. **Lead**: Organizer, decision maker (tie breaker)
1. **Facilitator**: Shares screen and facilitates the guild meetings
1. **Member**: Regular attendee
1. **Participant**: Attends regular guild meetings and participates in discussion
1. **Secretary**: Takes notes, organizes recurring meetings, communication 

## Guild outcomes
Outcomes are determined through discussion during the routine guild meeting. Any outcome is fine (even none), but 
the following opportunities could be considered:

1. Update the documentation handbook
1. Engage other guilds by adding cards or feedback to other boards
1. Create or update a lab or pro dev activity
1. Create or update a guild
1. Create or update a service
