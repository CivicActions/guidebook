# CivicActions Documentation 

The Documentation Working Group expects changes and additions to this handbook to come out of solutions to “struggles” or “tensions” discussed within practice area working groups (such as the PM Group, the Sales Guild, etc).

## Process

* Each practice area shall assign one person from that area to be responsible for documentation updates for a certain period of time.
* The trial time period for “documentation rep” responsibilities shall be one month, followed by a handoff to the next rep from that practice area.
* Each practice area is encouraged to organize their folder in the handbook according to their needs and priorities.
* Current documentation reps are asked to attend a brief weekly docs scrum call, currently scheduled for Thursdays at 12:30pm Pacific time.
