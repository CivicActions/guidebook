Depending on your role, you may be asked to travel for a Bloom project.
Due to COVID-19, we are not traveling for projects at the moment

Here's how we manage travel related expenses and reimbursements:

## Scheduling Travel and Incurring Expenses
All travel and expenses should be pre-approved by Lauren or Emily. You’ll book travel and other expenses on your personal credit card and will be reimbursed. (If you have an issue doing this, please reach out to Lauren or Emily) Policies will differ on a project-by-project basis. But in general, you should plan to book your travel in coordination with others on the project.

### Train/Flights
Do your best to keep these costs low, within reason. We recognize we don’t always have much lead time to book travel, so plan to book as soon as possible in coordination with your project team.

### Lodging
Aim to keep these costs in alignment with the federal guidelines for lodging per diems, making use of government rates when applicable. If you are working on a government project, chances are you can utilize government rates.

### Cabs/Transportation
Needs will vary on a project-by-project basis, but a general rule is to keep this below $50/day.

### Meals & Incidentals
Policies will differ between projects, so please check with Lauren and Emily for guidance if you're not sure. For all State of CT work, you will be given a per diem for meals and incidentals. The per diem is $45.75 for any days that involve travel to/from CT and $61.00 for any days spent entirely in CT. As a result, you do not need to submit receipts for meals. Instead, in Harvest you should submit an expense of $45.75 for each travel day and $61 for each full day in CT.
Tracking Expenses

You’ll need to log all expenses in Harvest with receipts attached (except meals — more on that above). Please track the expenses based on the date of the work travel — not when the expense was incurred (e.g., if you book a flight in May for a flight in June, you should list the date of the flight as the date of the expense instead of the date you booked the flight).

If you have any additional questions, please reach out to Sofia.
