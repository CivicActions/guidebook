## We all need a break sometimes and we believe in taking the time you need for yourselves and/or your families.

You do not need to justify time off, and whenever possible please try to arrange it in advance with your project team. 

### Full-time employees

- Employees who work 33+ hours per week are considered Full Time. They receive 120 hours of vacation and 40 hours of sick leave each year (year begins at the time of hire). 
-  Up to 40 hours (5 days) of unused vacation and 40 hours (5 days) of unused sick leave can be carried over each year ("year" starts at the anniversary of your employment).
-  Bloom also offers an additional 64 hours (8 days) of Floating Holiday time to be used at the employees discretion. The office is closed collectively between Christmas (Dec 25) and New Years (Jan 01) and is considered holiday time outside of the Floating Holidays. 
-  If, for any reason, you are unable to work the expected hours on your project for reasons other than PTO (if for example your project team or role on the project is blocked) please notify someone on the Bloom management team (Lauren, Emily or Sofia). We will help determine the right next steps.

### Part-time employees

- Employees who work 32 or fewer hours per week will receive a prorated amount of vacation and floating holiday time. 
- Employees are still entitled to 40 hours (5 days) of sick time. 
- The unused carry over rate of unused PTO and sick time will be determined upon hire, depending on the number of expected work hours.  

### Contractors
- Please manage your schedule and take the time you need. Please give us some notice where possible and connect with us to discuss making sure our partners are aware of time off (as needed). 

## Terms upon employee departure
- ONLY unused vacation time will be paid out upon departure. 
- Any unused floating holiday and sick time will be considered forfeit. 

**Whenever possible please give at least 2 weeks advance notice of planned time off, this will help us on project resourcing.**

## Written documentation of time off

If an employee uses PTO for sick leave, including sick leave under applicable state or local law, for more than three consecutive scheduled work days, Bloom Works may require reasonable documentation of the purpose for such leave. If the reason for time off is due to an employee's or a family member's own medical condition, verification from a health care provider is appropriate, but should not explain the nature of the condition and should not result in an unreasonable burden or expense on the employee. If the reason for time off is due to an employee's need for leave related to domestic violence, verification may include a police report, court order or other evidence from the court or a prosecuting attorney, other documentation from a victim advocate, attorney, member of the clergy, a medical or other professional, or an employee's own written statement.

Bloom Works also reserves the right to require documentation verifying an employee's need to use time off, if there are indications of a pattern of abuse, such as repeated use of unscheduled time off on or adjacent to weekends, holidays, or pay day, regardless whether the employee has used time off for more than three consecutive days.

## Time off and other approved leave

Time off pursuant to this policy is not intended for long-term leave or as a long-term care solution. As such, exempt employees on leaves of absences for more than thirty days, including otherwise unpaid leaves of absences, will not be eligible for paid time off beyond the first thirty days. Bloom Works will require non-exempt employees to exhaust accrued, unused PTO concurrently with extended leaves of absences, including under the Family and Medical Leave Act or comparable state laws, if applicable.

Employees who are eligible for any other paid leave under Bloom Works policies will not receive paid time off under this policy while on such paid leave (for example, parental leave) in addition to other paid leave. Likewise, time off and any other paid leaves shall run concurrently such that the duration of any leave shall not extend beyond the longer of the available leave. For instance, an employee may be eligible for eight weeks of paid parental leave under Bloom Works' policy, but will not be eligible for additional time off after such leave.

Similarly, employees who are eligible for wage replacement benefits while on an approved leave (for example, an employee who is eligible for workers' compensation, short-term disability, or long-term disability) will not receive paid time off compensation except as provided below.

If an employee remains absent for seven or more calendar days due to his or her own illness or injury, the employee must apply for short-term disability benefits through the state-provided plan or, if applicable, a company-provided plan, by contacting Sofia to initiate a disability claim. Absences covered by short-term disability, including pregnancy-related disabilities, are not eligible for paid time off under this policy. If the company becomes aware that an absence may qualify for short-term disability benefits, management or the People Ops Team will direct the employee to contact Guardian to apply for short-term disability benefits.

For information or questions concerning this policy and the use of time off during otherwise unpaid leaves of absence or short-term disability the employee should contact Sofia for assistance.

## Abuse of time off

Abuse of time off, including as legally-mandated paid sick leave, may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Disciplinary action may be taken if a pattern of potential abuse of time off develops, if an employee is failing to attain necessary goals for his or her position, or if an excessive number of absences occur that are beyond the scope of any approved FMLA leave, approved disability leave, or leave provided as a reasonable accommodation.

## State and local paid sick leave laws

To the extent state or local laws mandate paid sick leave, this policy is intended to ensure that eligible employees who work in those jurisdictions accrue and receive paid sick leave in accordance with those requirements. Bloom Works prohibits discrimination or retaliation against employees because of a request for time off for legally-protected paid sick leave purposes, or use of such time off. If you believe that you have been treated unfairly on account of your use of such time off, or request for such time off, please immediately report this concern to Sofia so that the matter may be reviewed and appropriate corrective action may be taken.

## Personal tech issues

At Bloom Works, we understand that having occasional issues with your home network, power and personal equipment are a normal part of working from home.

### Communication

When you have a technical issue with your home network, power and personal equipment that stops you from being able to work at all, communicate early and often:

1. Ping your team in Slack to let them know you aren't available.
1. Set a Slack status (if you can,) so people know you aren't available.
1. If you aren't able to access Slack, deputize your work contact to let your PM(s) and team know.
1. If the problem lasts longer than 2 hours, email Sofia and then log it in Harvest under Bloom Works: Timeoff, using the task "Technical Issues".
1. If it's persistent, set an out of office message.

## Personal leave of absence

Employees of Bloom Works, including part-time employees, who have worked for at least one year may request a personal leave of absence. A leave of absence is for extended periods, typically four weeks or more, where an employee is fully or part-time away from work, for example taking courses/training, handling extended personal matters, completing a personal project, or world travel. Leaves will be discussed on a case by case basis and may be paid, partially paid or unpaid.

## Parental leave

Welcoming a new child is an amazing time for a family and we want to support employees during this time to take the time to bond with their new child (by birth or adoption, or placement in foster care if the child is under the age of 18, or incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability) and acclimate to the new life ahead. Our policy is that expectant parents can take eight weeks of leave fully paid after 9 months of employment. If an employee has been at the company for less than 9 months or if for any reason the expectant parent needs additional leave, we will review requests on a case-by-case basis. All Parental Leave described in this Policy shall be available for a 12-month period following the birth or adoption of a child.

For birthing mothers there is also the option to use short-term disability for additional paid leave time. Please contact Sofia for more information on this benefit.
