# Tech Issues

## Be Prepared

We will all have issues with our machines, internet connections, power outages, etc. Have a plan to try to avoid those problems and to try to keep unexpected interuptions as short as possible. Ask someone in advance if they are willing to be your work contact and save their number in your phone, just in case.

## Communicaton

Communicate early and often. 

1. Ping your team in Slack to let them know you aren't available.
2. Set a Slack status (if you can,) so people know you aren't available.
3. If you aren't able to access Slack, deputize your work contact to let your PM(s) and team know. 
4. If the problem lasts longer than 2 hours, email <mailto:ca-schedule@civicactions.net> and follow our sick leave policy and follow the procedure for [logging sick time off](../04-how-we-work/tools/harvest.md) in Harvest with CivicActions and then write "tech support" in when you log your time. 
5. If it's persistent, set an out of office message.
