# General Business Expenses
Bloom Works will timely reimburse pre-approved business-related out-of-pocket expenses as long as you submit a receipt. 
Receipts MUST show the card used (last 4 digits) and a date in order to be accepted. 

*Before incurring any expense* the cost should be estimated and approved by the budget owner. The ONLY exception to this being prodev expenses of less than $50, which do not require pre-approval. 

 ## Process
Once you have estimated the total cost of the expense(s), message the buget owner to request approval. In most cases the budget owner will be the project lead, be sure to include any necessary detail / substantiation to the expense. 
 
 When approved log on to Harvest > Expenses. You must fill in the following fields:  
 - Date: should be the date reflected on the receipt
 - Project: if it's a client project be sure to select that here and mark as unabillable. Bloom has a separate category for ProDev related expenses, more on that later. 
 - Category: select the best fit from the dropdown
 - Receipt: include the actual paper receipt AND an image showing the budget owner approval of the expense
 
 If you DO NOT see your project code or an appropriate category code contact Sofia.
