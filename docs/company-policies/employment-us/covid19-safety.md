# COVID-19 Safety and Vaccine Policy

Employees are not required to provide proof of vaccinations, but we follow CDC recommendations and standards for work events where more than one person is present. CivicActions follows guidance provided by CDC for in person events. Specifically, individuals who have recently tested positive for COVID-19, are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and are waiting on test results, may not attend in-person events. Individuals who have recently been exposed to someone with COVID-19 should follow CDC recommendations before attending any in person events.

If you are not currently fully vaccinated we encourage you to prioritize scheduling an appointment to get vaccinated or speak with your medical provider about what is best for your circumstances. Our flexible time off policy allows individuals to take time off for medical appointments during work hours, including to get vaccines. We encourage you to prioritize getting all vaccines recommended by your provider as soon as practical. Project Managers and supervisors are expected to prioritize work schedules to give team members time to get vaccinated or to get other medical care as soon as practical.
