# CivicActions Marketing

The marketing team uses a community-driven approach to strategically attract the right talent, clients, and partners to work with CivicActions. Marketing is also a way for us to promote best practices and help shape the conversation around government digital services. We do this through a variety of initiatives such as:

- [Homesite at civicactions.com](https://civicactions.com/)
- [Blog](https://medium.com/civicactions)
- [Public speaking](https://medium.com/civicactions/tagged/civicactions-talks) at events and online
- Contributions to industry organizations such as [ACT-IAC](https://www.actiac.org/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/civicactions), [Technologists for the Public Good](https://www.publicgood.tech/), and others
- Social media such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/civicactions), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CivicActions/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/civicactions/)
- Cultivating opportunities to appear in [press and news](https://civicactions.com/press)

## Marketing-related Slack channels

We welcome everyone at CivicActions to be part of the conversation about how to best reach our audiences with valuable content and ideas. Here are some Slack channels you can drop into for marketing related discussions:

- `#marketing`: Discussion on marketing strategy, content, initiatives, press, and general quesions or ideas
- `#brand`: Brand-related assets, projects, resources, questions (logos, colors, styles, templates, letterhead...)
- `#events`: General discussion, planning, and questions about events we may attend or sponsor. There are also channels specific to core events like #event-drupal-govcon, #event-cfa-summit, etc.
- `#civicactions-homesite`: Discussion, feedback, ideas, and project management for civicactions.com. You can also use this channel to request an update to any homesite content, such as your staff profile.

## Brand
The CivicActions brand is professional yet friendly. You can get our logo, colors, and brand guidelines from the [CivicActions Style Guide](https://civicactions-style-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README/). Please refer to this guide for all brand questions, or ask us in the `#brand` Slack channel.

Here are some commonly requested branded templates that you can use:  

- [Presentation templates](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/?tgif=d&ftv=1) (Note: When you click a template from the Google Slides Template Gallery, it automatically creates a copy that you can edit. You don't have to worry about over-writing the template.)
- Document templates (e.g., letterhead)
- One-pager templates (COMING SOON)

## Events

We attend events and conferences for a number of purposes, including:

- Recruitment
- Business development
- Professional development
- Community participation / networking
- Public speaking

**Core events**  
The current list of "core events" that CivicActions sponsors and attends each year includes:

- LibrePlanet (March)
- DrupalCon North America (April)
- Code for America Summit (May)
- DevOps Days DC (July)
- Drupal GovCon (July)

**Event sponsorship and attendance are on hold until public health considerations are resolved.**

### Speaking at events

We highly encourage team members to share knowledge at conferences and have a number of initiatives to support these efforts.

CivicActions will pay all costs for travel, registration, attendance, etc., for any team member that has a conference presentation accepted at a Core Event (see Core Events list above).

Here's a [running list of public presentations](https://airtable.com/shrK3eh7Nrx9vNtXt) by CivicActions folks.
To get started or share an idea about attending or speaking at events, head over to the Slack channel #events.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
CivicActions will pay all costs up to $1200/year per person to be used for travel, registration, attendance, etc. for any team member that has conference presentation accepted at a Non-Core Event. (Community Participation > Speaking Stipend)

The Stipend is available three months after the beginning of employment and is reset at the calendar year. Speaking submissions and participation at non-core events are completely at the discretion of every team member, but we request you take into account your project delivery's schedule and check-in with your Project Manager to make sure it won't negatively impact your client delivery expectations.
