# Organizational structure

In 2021 CivicActions undertook a shift from a fairly flat organization that had a small management team, to a matrix organization that introduced new levels of leadership. [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DU5pPbhMH0_PzkOohvHPknQ-xvQz9CZfUFYD2WNQtpI/edit?usp=sharing) is to serve as a single source of information that includes a summary of current state of organization, links to current org structure and other relevant links, and what is complete and still in-motion.
