# Bloom Works Resume and Portrait Instructions

Now that you're part of the team, we want to add you to our team page!

## How to get your photo on the BloomWorks Team Page:
 • Check out [our website](https://bloomworks.digital/team) to get a general feel for what we’re serving up already
 • If you have an image that is similar in layout and vibe, either attach it to a response email or send it to me via slack
 • If you need to take a new photo, try to get in some natural light, and position the camera further than selfie range if possible
 
If you have questions, reach out to Adam on Zoom or via [email](mailto:adam@bloomworks.digital)
 
## Team Resume Instructions

We sometimes get requests for team resumes, especially for our RFX responses. We use a template for formatting team resumes so they are consistent.
* [Check out the resume template on GDrive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IS46KYx0JhVQKmTGxg8M_wS6nJSkADg35j3DynwWw5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
* Create a Copy and move it to the Bloom Full Team Drive > Team > Bios, photos, resumes folder
* Once you've finished editing share it with Sofia Forelle, she'll schedule any review time with you if needed. 
 
Aaaaand that’s it. Just a few simple steps and you too can be a staple of the BloomWorks Team Page! Huzzah and Hooray!
