# Bloom Works Bio and Portrait Instructions

Now that you're part of the team, we want to add you to our team page!

## Bio Process

1.  Review this [template](https://docs.google.com/a/civicactions.net/document/d/130qr5b3pCw6tf9-V9tDxYfm2qfU1flQWwL2M5X76yIk/edit?usp=sharing)
2.  Make a COPY of the template
3.  Make the doc accessible to "everyone at Bloom Works"
4.  Fill out the template as much as you can (as a rough draft)

## How to get your photo on the BloomWorks Team Page:
 • Check out https://bloomworks.digital/team to get a general feel for what we’re serving up already
 • If you have an image that is similar in layout and vibe, either attach it to a response email or send it to me via slack
 • If you need to take a new photo, try to get in some natural light, and position the camera further than selfie range if possible
 
Aaaaand that’s it. Just a few simple steps and you too can be a staple of the BloomWorks Team Page! Huzzah and Hooray!

If you have questions, reach out to Adam on Zoom or via email adam@bloomworks.digital.
