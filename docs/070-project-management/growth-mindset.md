# Growth Mindset

## What is Mindset?

Definition: underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence.

## What is Growth Mindset?

Definition from Carol Dweck: When students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger. Therefore they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to higher achievement.

## Why?

- We work at a rapid pace and under tight deadlines
- At times we will trip over each other

If we think of giving and receiving feedback to other team members in terms of

- Role
- The project as a whole

Then we may embrace a growth mindset, or the idea that team improvement happens at the individual level and only via effective iterations.

## How to Give and Receive Feedback

### Give Feedback

- Focus on the project first, and the role second
- Ask permission to give feedback, confirming that the recipient is willing to absorb it
- Use the phrase, "It would be better for me ifâ€¦" (again focusing on your role and that of the other person)
- Stop talking and listen

Remember:

- Feedback is founded on confidentiality and trust
- It is critical to confirm the timing for the feedback to be received
- The solution lies within the recipient

### Receive Feedback

- Listen and Be Present
- Close your laptop
- Put phone away
- Focus only on Zoom
- Demonstrate active Listening
- Maintain eye contact
- Be mindful of posture
- Hear it from the place of being role- and project-based
- Hear it from the place of the person trusting you enough to share it
- Ask a clarifying question. For example, "Would it help if I ...?"

Remember:

- The person telling you is working to improve the team; they care about your success
