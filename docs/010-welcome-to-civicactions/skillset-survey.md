# Skills Self Assessment

- Learn about [Skills Base](../050-how-we-work/tools/skills-base.md) and complete an initial self-assessment
- If you gain new qualifications (including background checks, project trainings etc) log into Skills Base and add them
- Come back annually and update your skills and qualifications - this will allow you to track your progress over time
