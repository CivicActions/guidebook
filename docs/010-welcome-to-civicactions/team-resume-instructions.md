# Team Resume Instructions

We sometimes get requests for team resumes. We use a template for formatting team resumes so they are consistent.

## Process

1. Make a copy of the resume template
2. Follow the examples to fill out your information.
3. When you are complete with your resume, save it in the resumes folder on Google Drive. Include the certs and degrees listed in your resume.
4. A CivicActions team member will review your resume.
