# Team Resume Instructions

We sometimes get requests for team resumes. We use a template for formatting team resumes so they are consistent.

## Process

1. Make a copy of the resume template from here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVjUOql0sogCaIWGClpRpcUDir62SKT7HJ8r0rvtZkY/edit
2. Follow the examples to fill out your information.
3. When you are complete with your resume, export it as a PDF and save it in the resumes folder on Google Drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wt1KObSnraOnyDjUtK9chSHldsis9hiC.
4. Include the certs and degrees listed in your resume.
5. A CivicActions team member will review your resume.
