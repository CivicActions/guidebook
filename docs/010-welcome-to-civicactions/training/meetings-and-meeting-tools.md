# Your own

Remember that you can book time on your own calendar. We recommend blocking off your own "heads down" time in two-to-four hour chunks to complete tasks. You should also block off times where you don't want to get booked for meetings (eg a doctor's appt or long lunch with a friend).

Also, if you're planning a meeting, be sure to state your goal (what the meeting is and what it isn't) in an agenda and invite description.

## Bloom Time

Our Bloom Time meetings includes everyone across Bloom Works, and it's how the team disseminates news, updates, and congratulations. You aren't required to attend the all hands, but you are strongly encouraged to â€“ it's where big announcements are made, and attending is a great way to put names to faces. The agenda is posted beforehand in Trello (add link), you are welcome to add topics for discussion, and chatter during and following the call happens in [#general](https://bloom-digital.slack.com/messages/general). 

- We use Zoom for this - see [more about Zoom](../../050-how-we-work/tools/zoom.md)
- Everyone on team is encouraged to join
- Invites with links are pre-set on staff calendars.
