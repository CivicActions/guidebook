This is all a lot and we recognize it takes some time to settle in and absorb it all. We have a few essential suggestions to keep in mind while you settle in:   

-  **Work Schedule** We have team members in varying time zones and with different work schedules. We trust you to manage your time in a way that helps you fulfill your hours and role and do what you gotta do in other parts of your life. We believe you can do YOU and your work. 

-  **Calendars** Sharing your calendars and making sure they are up to date is a really helpful practice for the team to schedule meetings, etc. *Calendar tip: you can set your working hours in the settings and it will reflect on your calendar when people try to schedule meetings with you*

-  **Managing projects and priorities** Some of us are managing multiple projects at any given time. If you have any questions or concerns about priorities, please connect with your project leads and Lauren and Emily. 

- **Communication** Sharing information in a timely and transparent way is crucial when working remotely. We use slack as a virtual office space to connect with others on the team, so you should feel free to say hi or otherwise ping people there just as you would if they were sitting at the desk next to you during work hours. Also, we have a number of different slack channels to browse and join if you feel called. [Here's a listing](https://app.slack.com/client/TEMAF4B7E/browse-channels/thread/CELT2MY7K-1607119869.001500) *Rule of thumb: When in doubt, over-communicate.*  

-  **Remote work life** Working remotely can be an adjustment for those who are new to it. It can work well to develop practices that support managing your time, space, and well-being like: working a generally regular schedule, making sure to take little breaks from the screen (you can plank with us!), connecting with others on the team just because and also for tricks they use to stay productive and whole. 

-  **Writing style guide** Yes, we have one! Take a look at, and use the Bloom [writing style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1YSRuu0traltiKHJ1drc8xT4EWeZfqjX_KSN2RK0Pc/edit#heading=h.g5pyyoerqoo3) as needed. This ensures we're all using best practices for writing in an accessible and consistent way.

While we can all get busy, if you run into issues around work practices, project stuff, need some clarity reach out to Emily or Lauren sooner rather than later, and they will do their best to help you.

*We would love to hear other bits of wisdom the team has on this front so please comment below if you have additional thoughts we can integrate!*
