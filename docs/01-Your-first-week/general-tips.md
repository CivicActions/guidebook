# Tips for success

We recognize that it takes time to settle in and absorb everything that comes along with a new job. Here are a few tried-and-true suggestions from the team to help:

- **Work Schedule** –– We have team members in varying time zones and with different work schedules. We trust you to manage your time in a way that helps you fulfill your hours, get the job done, and do what you gotta do in other parts of your life. We believe you can do YOU and your work.

- **Calendars** –– To help everyone schedule meetings without a lot of back and forth, share your calendar and make sure it's up to date. Calendar tip: Go to calendar settings and enter your work hours. Your calendar will display this when people try to schedule meetings with you.

- **Managing projects and priorities** –– Some of us are juggling multiple projects at any given time. If you have any questions or concerns about priorities, please connect with your project leads, Lauren, or Emily.

- **Communication** –– As a remote team, it's crucial that we share information in a timely and transparent way. We use Slack as a virtual office space to connect with others on the team. Feel free to say 'hi' or otherwise ping people there, just as you would if they were sitting at the desk next to you. We also have a number of different Slack channels to browse and join if you feel called. Here's a listing Rule of thumb: When in doubt, over-communicate.

- **Remote work life** –– Working remotely can be an adjustment if you're new to it. We recommend developing practices that support managing your time, space, and well-being, like: working a generally regular schedule, making sure to take little breaks from the screen (you can plank with us!), connecting with others on the team just because, and asking other remote folks about the tricks they use to stay productive and whole.

- **Writing style guide** Yes, we have one! [Take a look at, and use the Bloom writing style guide as needed.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1YSRuu0traltiKHJ1drc8xT4EWeZfqjX_KSN2RK0Pc/edit?usp=sharing) This ensures we're all using best practices for writing in an accessible and consistent way.

While we can all get busy, we're always willing to try and help each other out. If you run into issues around work practices or project stuff, reach out to Emily or Lauren sooner rather than later.
