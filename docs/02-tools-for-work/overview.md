# Equipment & tools we use right now

Here's more about the equipment and tools you will be using with us to GSD: 

## Computer/hardware
Bloom is a bring-your-own-device workplace — we each bring the equipment of our choice to enable work and particularly remote work (e.g. web cams). 
We work hard to make sure the collaboration tools we use are compatible with all devices so you can keep working with whatever system suits you best. 
*Note: we provide a tech stipend for all salaried Bloom folks (more on that later)*

## Email
When you join Bloom (yay), you’ll be issued a google-based @bloomworks.digital email address. Besides being a useful communication tool, it’ll also serve as **your entry point to all the other tools**. 

This will be the main address you use to more formally communicate with our partners on projects. 

**Setting up your email signature**
You can use our [template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaK-lQacImYNa-fyfDrY5iIvU5X7gSm1bq0ilfa1tBI/edit?usp=sharing). If you have any questions Slack Sofia. 

## Slack
Our central slack workspace is govbloomdigital.slack.com which you can access [here](https://join.slack.com/t/govbloomdigital/signup). For some projects, we may join teams on separate workspaces. We’ll grant you access to those on a project-by-project basis. 
Keep in mind that some slack channels and workspaces may include our partners/clients. For an introduction to using slack, check out, [their guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members), to getting started.  

Here's a quick intro to our internal channels: 
- Bloomers: this is a locked internal channel (generally where new HR policies, etc are posted)
- Familiars: for sharing cute pictures and stories of our favorite people (kids, partners, pets, you name it)
- General: for company-wide announcements and work-cased matters
- Good Reads: link sharing for relevant articles, events, and other pieces of interest
- Hiring: a space to share hiring ideas and discuss logistics. *NOT* to be used to discuss individual candidates. 
- Random: when you're not sure where to share it
- Water Cooler: this is the office safe space for chatting about anything, think of it as the company break room
- BD General: business development team discussion space, especially for proposals
- BD Opportunities: Sharing RFX's of interest
- Bloom Comms: 
- Bloom Website: for BW website updates
- Data Viz: for all things data visualization related
- Lurkers: some folks like to be in our slack but aren't employees, maybe they will be one day or maybe they were before
- Tech: Github help, security policy questions, anything technically related

## Trello
We use trello to collaborate on tasks for our various projects. Each project has a separate board which you’ll be granted access to upon joining. Each team will use trello a bit differently so please defer to your project lead and any team norms on how to use the project board. 
For generic information on using trello, see their [getting started guide](https://trello.com/en-US/guide/trello-101).
If you need to be invited to our organization you can ask JJ or Sofia for help. 

## Zoom
You can use whatever video conferencing tool is easiest for team-related calls but we generally use Zoom for more formal calls with partners. Sometimes you will need to adjust to what a partner uses (e.g. Microsoft Teams)
In general team members will receive free account access, so your meeting times will be limited to 40 minutes. If you think your meeting will need to run longer, contact Sofia so she can arrange a meeting from a paid account. 

## Mural
This whiteboarding tool is used mainly during the discovery phases of our work but can be used as a facilitation tool for other meetings. 
We have a [shared organization](https://app.mural.co/t/bloom5049) with limited licenses. If you need facilitator access you can slack Sofia. 

## Gusto (salaried employees only)
This is the system we use to process payroll, and where you’ll request paid time off and sick leave. More on that later. 

## Harvest (for both employees + contractors)
This is the platform that we use for expenses and time tracking. **You must log your hours on a daily basis**, this is a compliance necessity so please make sure to add this to your regular daily workflow. 
This is also where you will log any expenses you incur for work travel. Please see [How Billing Works card](https://trello.com/c/MDeCS2Sd) below for more details on billing categories and invoices. 

## T Sheets (for State of CT work only)
This is the platform our partners at Skylight use for time tracking. Each day, you’ll need to log the hours you worked related to any State of CT projects.
Skylight will send you an invitation to the platform separately, if you don't see if on your first day contact Sofia. 

*Note: If you don't need but don't have access to any of the tools listed above -or- if you need tools that aren't listed above then please contact Sofia for getting an account.*
