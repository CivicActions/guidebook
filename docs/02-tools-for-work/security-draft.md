# Password security

Passwords are an important aspect of computer security. They are the front line of protection for user accounts. A poorly chosen password may result in the compromise of Bloom Works' entire corporate network. As such, all Bloom Works employees (including contractors and vendors with access to Company systems) are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select and secure their passwords.

### Password recommendations 

- Avoid repeating passwords for multiple websites
- Passwords should be at least 8-15 characters in length. The longer, the better 
- Use a mix of digits and punctuation characters (e.g., 0-9 and !@#$%^&*)
- Avoid using common words or phrases (e.g., "password" or "Hello")
- **NEVER** base your password on personal information, names of family members, etc. 
  

Passwords should not be shared with anyone. If this is unavoidable be sure to reset your password ASAP. 

All passwords are to be treated as sensitive, confidential information. If someone requests your password(s), please inform him or her that you cannot provide that information per Bloom Works policy. If you suspect an account or password has been compromised, report the incident immediately to Sofia and change all related passwords.

We recommend the use of a password manager program to help ensure that all passwords are strong, unique and easily changed. 

Passwords should never be written down or stored on your web browser. Try to create passwords that can be easily remembered. One way to do this is to create a password based on a song title, affirmation or other phrase. For example, the phrase might be "This may be one way to remember," and the password could be "TmB1w2R!" or "Tmb1W>r~" or some other variation.

### 2FA

If you're given the option to op-into 2FA please do so.
