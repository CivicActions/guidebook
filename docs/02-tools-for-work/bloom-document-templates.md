When in doubt, you can always refer back to the [Bloom Full Team google shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AOJVzBlrgkPcUk9PVA)

That is where we keep: 
- [Case Studies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TLBBLS_gLHOwbdY6HmFEAmhaW9AS-asI?usp=sharing)
- [Marketing & Communications](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CpFv0REjol60RMnmlus3sub1U9QbLCsl?usp=sharing): for things like Blom's visual style guide, writing guide, and sample proposal reponses
- [Team](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ifDUZX6Tq3CBvV03-49yNVeSIFG3QC9S?usp=sharing): for team resumes and bios
- [Templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ba-TApkKF7hLt5K0PCqjVVwX9UJERQMD?usp=sharing)


**Note for my editor: are there other important links to add? Should this get integrated into another slide?
