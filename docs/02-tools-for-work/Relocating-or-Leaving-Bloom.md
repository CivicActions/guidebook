# Relocating
If you personally plan to relocate where you live, please give at least six weeks notice and request formal approval by sending an email to admin@bloomworks.digital. After you receive formal,
written approval, be sure to update Gusto with your new address, along with the effective date.

Following these steps are important for several reasons:
- It gives us the necessary time to make sure we’ve completed any required state & local payroll tax registrations so your and the company’s taxes are computed correctly.
- It helps us avoid issues with trying to do payroll gymnastics if we don’t get all the required registrations done in time.
-  It allows us to make sure it won’t cause issues with your client and/or team. This is rarely the case; nevertheless, it’s important that we check.

## Temporary Relocation
If you plan to work away from your primary work location where there’s a significant difference in timezone or you’re out of the country, please seek approval beforehand as we may need to
make sure, for example, that it won’t be an issue with your particular contract, client, or team. As a specific example, some clients have policies against accessing systems outside the country.
In general, we try to be as flexible and accommodating as possible, but there may be some important factors to take into account.


# Leaving Bloom Works

## At-Will Employment

All employment with Bloom Works is "at will". The relationship can be terminated by the employee or by Bloom Works at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice. But being who we are, we typically work together for a smooth transition.

## Resignation

Employees are asked to provide a minimum of 2 weeks written notice of their intent to resign (if possible). The notice should be submitted to the employee's manager or to someone on the management team. An exit interview may be requested.

## Termination

If Bloom Works sees a problem with an employee's performance, or there is otherwise clearly a bad fit between the employee and Bloom Workss, every effort will be made to remedy the issue(s). If termination turns out to be the only solution the employee will be fully aware of, and probably in agreement with, the reasons.

## Return of Company Property

Any company property issued to employees, such as documents, computer equipment or company credit cards, must be returned to Bloom Works at the time of separation.

## Continuation of Benefits

COBRA

If you or your covered dependents lose eligibility for regular group medical, dental, and vision benefits, you may be eligible to continue your coverage under COBRA. COBRA allows you to continue receiving these benefits on a temporary basis in certain situations where coverage under the United Healthcare Benefits Plan would otherwise end. Contact Sofia Forelle for more details.

## Offboarding process

The person doing the offboarding should duplicate the `template list` on the `Offboarding` Trello board. All the tasks needed to offboard someone from Bloom Works are listed as task cards. There will need to be collaboration with others in company to fully offboard someone - such as the project/practice area teams removing them from specific tools. An important step is to also talk with the person departing Bloom Works to ensure they remove project or company work from their personal machines, and return any equipment or property back toBloom Works.

Bloom Works will also post a message in #announcements about the person departing Bloom Works. We will intentionally post a message that preserves the privacy of the person leaving Bloom Works.

### Manager

- Work with the employee to transition the employee's workload to other team members.
- Ensure they complete their last timesheet in Harvest.
