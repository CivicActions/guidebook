We want to make getting paid and tracking time as smooth as possible. Here's how we do it: 

# Getting Paid
---------------------

## Employees
We use a service called Gusto to process our payroll. Pay days are twice per month (the 15th and month end). You’ll be asked to add your information (including bank information) into Gusto. You can also manage benefits in this space (more on that later). 

For any travel expenses you incur and log in Harvest, you’ll be reimbursed during the first pay period of the following month. More on travel and expenses below. 

## Independent Contractors
On the last workday of each month, please submit your invoice to admin@bloomworks.digital. Any format works for us as long as it includes the total hours worked that month and all travel related expenses that tie out exactly to the expenses and hours logged in Harvest.  Bloom works on a Net-30 basis (i.e. you will get paid 30 days after an invoice is submitted).

**And to get paid, you need to track your time...**

# Time Tracking
------------------------------

## Salaried Employees
All salaried employees are expected to work 40 hours per week (85-95% billable) unless you have another arrangement with Bloom. Therefore, 34-38+ hours should be billable if you are full time on a project. You must update your hours worked each day in Harvest and in T Sheets (for CT team only). Check out the card on https://trello.com/c/MDeCS2Sd for more information on how to account for your hours in Harvest.

For any weeks where you work fewer than 40 hours, you should log paid time off (PTO), holiday, or sick time in Harvest (project is Bloom > Holiday/PTO/sick) and also formally request the time in Gusto. See the card on https://trello.com/c/bOtixcay for more information on PTO, holiday, and sick policies.

*Note: On the last workday of each month, please make sure all of your hours are up to date. For the State of CT team: ensure the hours you have logged in T Sheets match the PDG-related hours you’ve logged in Harvest.* 

## Independent Contractors
All contractors must update hours worked each day in Harvest. The number of hours you expect to work each week should be determined with your Bloom point person (Lauren or Emily) at the time of hire. Some fluctuations between weeks are to be expected, and if you find yourself needing to work meaningfully less or more than initially discussed, please flag this for your point person (Lauren or Emily).  

*Note: On the last workday of each month, please make sure all of your hours are up to date, and send an invoice to admin@bloomworks.digital*
