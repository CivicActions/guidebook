# Engineering Project Roles

These are the engineering roles and responsibilities on a project team. This is how we role.

Very important note: these are roles, not individuals. This means that:

- One individual could perform one role on one project and another role on another project (e.g. a TL on project A could also be a themer on project B).
- Multiple roles on a project could be shared by the same person (e.g. the TL could also be the LE or LT) - this is actually the norm for many small and medium projects.
- These roles are mostly for our internal communication purposes, so that we know who is responsible for what (even if that means that the same person is responsible of everything on a small project!). On bigger projects the importance of these roles becomes even more important, and is something that would be more client facing.
